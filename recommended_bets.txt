RECOMMENDED BETS
:

BET #1: Celtics vs Knicks Game 3 - Under 214.5 Total Points @ -110 (Stake: 3 units)
The public could be overreacting to the Knicks' hot start, inflating this total. The Celtics should tighten up defensively at home, leading to a lower-scoring game.

BET #2: Nuggets vs Thunder Series - Thunder Series Price +155 (Stake: 2 units)  
If Murray is out or limited, the Thunder's scoring duo of Gilgeous-Alexander and Holmgren should be able to take advantage. At this price, there is value backing OKC to advance.

BET #3: Nuggets vs Thunder Game 3 - Nikola Jokic Over 27.5 Points @ -115 (Stake: 2 units)
With Murray potentially out, Jokic's scoring load increases massively. Expect him to be ultra-aggressive hunting his shot against the smaller OKC frontcourt.

BET #4: Cavaliers vs Pacers Game 4 - Domantas Sabonis Over 19.5 Points @ -110 (Stake: 3 units) 
If Haliburton remains out, Sabonis will need to carry even more of the offensive burden. His scoring props could be underpriced as a result.

BET #5: Warriors vs Timberwolves Game 3 - Warriors -3 @ -110 (Stake: 2 units)
The Warriors should be motivated for a bounce-back effort at home after losing home court. With Curry likely playing, back the champs to take care of business.
