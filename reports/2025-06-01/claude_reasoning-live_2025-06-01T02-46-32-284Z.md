Let's analyze the provided betting opportunities, focusing on the live game between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks, as well as the upcoming game between Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers.

## Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks (IN PROGRESS)

First, I'll review what we know about this game:

1. The game is currently in progress
2. Based on the available spread odds, the Knicks (home team) appear to be significantly ahead, with spreads of -16.5 to -17.5 points
3. There's a large discrepancy in the odds across bookmakers for the same spreads
4. We don't have moneyline or totals information for this live game
5. We don't have information on the current game state (score, time remaining, etc.)
6. We don't have lineup information

Without knowing the current score, time remaining, or player performance, it's difficult to make a strong analysis of the live betting opportunities. However, we can infer that the Knicks have a substantial lead.

The spread odds show some interesting discrepancies:
- FanDuel has Knicks -17.5 at 124 and Pacers +17.5 at -166
- DraftKings has Knicks -17.5 at 280 and Pacers +17.5 at -395
- BetMGM has Knicks -16.5 at -350 and Pacers +16.5 at 250

There are some unusual odds here that suggest possible errors or rapidly changing markets. Normally, if a team is -17.5 points, their odds would be negative (e.g., -110), not positive (124 or 280). Similarly, the underdog getting +17.5 points would typically have positive odds or slightly negative odds, not deeply negative odds like -166 or -395.

Given these inconsistencies and the lack of additional context, I need to be extremely cautious with any live betting recommendations for this game.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers (UPCOMING)

For this upcoming game on 6/6/2025:

1. OKC is a strong favorite at home with moneyline odds around -400
2. The spread is between -8.5 and -9 points for OKC
3. The total points line is between 229.5 and 231 points
4. We don't have lineup information or injury updates

The odds are fairly consistent across bookmakers, suggesting a stable market for this upcoming game. OKC is clearly the heavy favorite, and the high total suggests an expected fast-paced, high-scoring game.

Let's analyze the potential betting opportunities:

### Spread Analysis (OKC vs Indiana)

The spread of -8.5 to -9 is substantial, suggesting the market views OKC as significantly stronger. Since this game is not yet in progress, I need to consider team strengths, recent form, and matchup dynamics.

While we don't have detailed team information, the consistency of odds across bookmakers suggests the market is confident in this spread. However, I notice a slight difference where FanDuel has -8.5 (-112) while DraftKings has -9 (-110). This suggests there might be slightly better value on the DraftKings line if backing OKC, as you're laying an extra half-point but getting slightly better odds.

### Totals Analysis (OKC vs Indiana)

The total of 229.5 to 231 is relatively high, indicating expectations of a fast-paced game. The slight discrepancy between bookmakers (FanDuel at 231, DraftKings at 229.5) presents a potential opportunity. If backing the over, the DraftKings line of 229.5 (-115) offers a lower hurdle, though at slightly worse odds than FanDuel's 231 (-110).

For the under, FanDuel's 231 (-110) would be the better option as it gives an extra 1.5 points cushion compared to DraftKings' 229.5 (-105), even though the odds are slightly worse.

### Potential Recommendations

Given the limited information available and the unclear situation with the live game, I'll focus on making recommendations for the upcoming OKC vs Indiana game, while being extremely cautious about the live game without more context.

For the Pacers vs Knicks live game:
Without knowing the current score, time remaining, or game context, I cannot confidently recommend any bets. The discrepancies in odds are concerning and suggest either rapidly changing markets or possible errors in the data.

For the OKC vs Indiana upcoming game:
1. The DraftKings spread for OKC -9 (-110) could offer slight value compared to FanDuel's -8.5 (-112)
2. For totals, FanDuel's Under 231 (-110) offers 1.5 points more cushion than DraftKings' Under 229.5 (-105)

However, without more team information, these recommendations come with lower confidence.

Let me finalize my bet recommendations:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. OKC Thunder -9 (-110) on DraftKings - 2 units
   - This spread offers better odds than FanDuel's -8.5 (-112), essentially paying less for an extra half point
   - OKC as a strong home favorite is a reasonable position

2. Under 231 points (-110) on FanDuel for OKC vs Indiana - 2 units
   - This provides 1.5 points more cushion than DraftKings' line
   - Without knowing team details, taking the under with the highest available point total offers value

For the live Pacers vs Knicks game, I don't have enough context to make a confident recommendation. The odds discrepancies suggest potential market inefficiencies, but without knowing the current game state, it would be irresponsible to recommend specific bets.

Actually, on further reflection, I notice that the odds for the Pacers vs Knicks spread markets look unusual. For instance, FanDuel has Knicks -17.5 (124) and Pacers +17.5 (-166). Typically, if a team is favored by 17.5 points, their odds would be negative (like -110), not positive (124). Similarly, the underdog getting 17.5 points would normally have positive odds, not -166.

These odd values make me suspect there might be an error in the data presentation or a misinterpretation of the odds format. Without clearer information, I cannot confidently recommend bets for this live game.

For the OKC vs Indiana game, the odds appear to be in a standard format and consistent across bookmakers, so I'm more confident in those recommendations.

Let me provide the final recommended bets table:
