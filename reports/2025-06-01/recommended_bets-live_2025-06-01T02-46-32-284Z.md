## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Knicks | Spread | Pacers +17.5 | -166 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Substantial leads often see regression as teams relax defensively. The spread discrepancy between books suggests value on the Pacers side at this number. |
| Pacers vs Knicks | Spread | Knicks -16.5 | -350 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: BetMGM offers a full point advantage compared to other books' -17.5 lines, creating line-shopping value if the Knicks maintain control. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9 | -110 | 3 | Clean odds at a key number with Oklahoma City positioned as a strong home favorite. Slightly better value than FanDuel's -8.5 (-112). |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 231 | -110 | 2 | FanDuel's higher total provides 1.5 points more cushion than DraftKings' 229.5 line, offering value on the under. |

For live betting, remember that timing is crucial. The Pacers spread recommendation assumes they haven't already begun a significant comeback, while the Knicks recommendation assumes their lead remains stable. Always verify the current game state before placing live wagers.
