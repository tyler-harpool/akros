## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -110 | 3 | Nine points is a significant cushion in the NBA. The Pacers' projected high-tempo offense should help them stay competitive even against a superior Thunder team. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 230.5 | -108 | 3 | Both teams typically play at fast paces, creating favorable conditions for a high-scoring affair. The slightly better odds on the over provide additional value. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +310 | 1 | While the Thunder should win, a small-stake play on the Pacers offers tremendous value at +310. NBA underdogs in this range win outright approximately 25-30% of the time. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alternative Spread | Thunder -4.5 | +140* | 2 | This provides a middle-ground approach - better odds than the Thunder moneyline while requiring a more modest margin of victory than the standard spread. |

*Note: The alternative spread odds are estimated based on standard NBA betting markets, as exact odds weren't provided.

Each bet is strategically allocated based on probability and potential return. The core recommendations (Pacers +9 and Over 230.5) provide the best balance of risk and reward in this matchup.
