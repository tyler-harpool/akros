## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 units | Large NBA spreads historically favor underdogs. 9.5 points provides significant cushion for a potential backdoor cover even if Pacers aren't competitive throughout. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -110 | 2 units | High totals often present slight value on the under. If game pace slows or shooting percentages regress, this total could fall short. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 | 1 unit | While Thunder should win, the implied 23% win probability for Pacers may be undervalued. The 3.3x return offers positive expected value if Pacers' true win probability exceeds 23%. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | +140 (estimated) | 1 unit | If you believe Thunder will win but the 9.5 spread is too high, this presents a middle-ground approach with plus-money odds while still giving OKC room for a comfortable win. |

These recommendations focus on statistical value and common NBA betting patterns given the limited context available for this matchup.
