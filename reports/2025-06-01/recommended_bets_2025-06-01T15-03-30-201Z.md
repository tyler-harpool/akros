## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 | 3 units | DraftKings offers better value than FanDuel's +9.5 at -112; the half-point difference comes with better juice, and significant cushion for the underdog |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 | 1 unit | Small-unit value play on the underdog at DraftKings' superior odds compared to FanDuel's +315 |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -110 | 2 units | High total presents value opportunity if game pace is slower than market anticipates; conservative position given lack of lineup data |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -175 | 2 units | Buying 2.5 points from the standard spread creates more cushion for the favorite while still maintaining reasonable odds |

Note that these recommendations are based on the current market conditions and limited information available. As lineup and injury information becomes available closer to tip-off, these positions should be reassessed.
