### Thunder vs Pacers Analysis:

1. **Moneyline Analysis**:
   - Thunder are heavy favorites with moneyline odds around -420/-425
   - This implies a win probability of approximately 81-82% for the Thunder
   - Pacers are significant underdogs at +330, implying about a 23% win probability
   - There's a small margin built in by the bookmakers here (the probabilities add up to slightly more than 100%)

2. **Spread Analysis**:
   - Thunder are favored by 9.5 points
   - The juice is slightly in favor of betting on the Thunder (-108) compared to the Pacers (-112)
   - A 9.5-point spread is substantial and indicates bookmakers expect a comfortable Thunder win

3. **Totals Analysis**:
   - Total set at 230.5 points
   - Even juice on both over and under (-110)
   - This is a relatively high total, suggesting bookmakers expect an up-tempo, high-scoring game

Without additional information on team form, lineups, injuries, or recent performance, it's challenging to identify clear edges. However, I can make some informed recommendations based on the betting lines and general NBA trends.

Let me think about potential bets:

1. **Pacers +9.5 (-112)**:
   - Large spreads often provide value on the underdog, especially in the NBA where late-game dynamics (fouling, garbage time) can affect final margins
   - A 9.5-point cushion is significant
   - The Pacers would need to keep the game within single digits to cover

2. **Under 230.5 (-110)**:
   - High totals can sometimes present value on the under
   - Without knowing the pace and defensive capabilities of these teams, this is speculative
   - However, playoff or important late-season games often have tighter defense and slower pace

3. **Pacers Moneyline (+330)**:
   - This is a high-risk, high-reward option
   - At +330, there might be some value if we believe the Pacers have better than a 23% chance to win outright
   - Without team information, this is more of a statistical value play than one based on matchup analysis

4. **Live Betting Opportunity**:
   - Given the large spread, there might be value in waiting to bet the Thunder if they fall behind early
   - Similarly, if the Thunder start strong, the live spread for the Pacers might increase to an even more favorable number

Based on the limited information and the betting lines provided, I'll make my recommendations focusing on statistical value and common NBA betting patterns.

Recommendations:

1. Pacers +9.5 (-112) - 2 units
   - Large NBA spreads often favor underdogs
   - 9.5 points provides significant cushion
   
2. Under 230.5 (-110) - 1 unit
   - High totals often present slight value on the under
   
3. Consider a small stake on Pacers ML (+330) - 0.5 units
   - High potential return if the Pacers can pull off the upset
   
4. Look for live betting opportunities - Either Thunder if they fall behind early or Pacers if the live spread increases beyond 12

Let me now format these into the requested RECOMMENDED BETS table.

Actually, before I finalize my recommendations, let me double-check the analysis:

I'm working with very limited information here - no team statistics, no lineup information, no injury reports, and no context about where these teams are in the standings or what's at stake in this game. This makes it difficult to provide truly insightful betting recommendations.

Given these constraints, my recommendations will be based primarily on general NBA betting principles and the odds provided:

1. Pacers +9.5 (-112): Large spreads in the NBA often provide value for the underdog. The spread of 9.5 points gives a significant cushion for the Pacers.

2. Under 230.5 (-110): High totals like 230.5 can sometimes present value on the under, especially if the game is more competitive than expected or if there are defensive adjustments.

3. Game Total 1H Under 114.5 (assuming standard first-half total approximately 5% lower than full game): First halves often see more conservative play and slightly lower scoring rates than second halves.

4. Pacers 1Q +3.5 (assuming standard first-quarter spread): First quarters often see tighter play before the favorite establishes dominance.

However, I realize I'm making assumptions about first-half and first-quarter lines that weren't provided in the data. I should stick to what I know.

So my final recommendations based strictly on the data provided would be:

1. Pacers +9.5 (-112) - 3 units
2. Under 230.5 (-110) - 2 units
3. Small stake on Pacers ML (+330) - 1 unit

The stakes reflect my confidence level in these bets given the limited information available.

I need to specify 3-5 concrete bet recommendations, so here are my final selections:
