## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 | Significant 28-point discrepancy between FanDuel (-190) and DraftKings (-218) odds suggests value on FanDuel. Denver should have the talent advantage in this divisional matchup. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 (DraftKings) | 3 | Warriors at near even money presents value against a Houston team that's likely still developing. Golden State's experience and shooting should make them competitive even on the road. |
| Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic (11/26/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | -102 (DraftKings) | 3 | 76ers at essentially even money against the Magic represents value, as Philadelphia traditionally has more star power and playoff experience than Orlando. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves vs Denver Nuggets (10/28/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves -1.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | Minimal spread suggests a close game, but Minnesota should have the home court advantage to cover this small margin, especially early in the season when home teams tend to perform better. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 | Even moneyline but favorable spread odds suggest value on the Mavericks, who should have more established talent than the rebuilding Spurs in this Texas rivalry game. |

These recommendations are based on odds analysis and projected team strength. As the actual game dates approach, these bets should be reevaluated with current lineup and injury information.
