## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets @ Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | Significant pricing discrepancy between bookmakers (DK -218 vs FD -190). FanDuel's price offers better value while still reflecting Nuggets' advantage. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/2025) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 | 3 units | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' spread (-10). Christmas games historically favor elite teams against weaker opponents. The spread pricing indicates FanDuel might have a more accurate line. |
| Houston Rockets @ Golden State Warriors (11/27/2025) | Moneyline | Rockets | -115 | 2 units | Priced as a near pick'em despite Warriors' home court. The -1 spread aligned with -115 moneyline suggests the Rockets are slightly undervalued here. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -105 | 2 units | With the moneyline priced at -110/-110, getting a point with the Spurs at only slightly worse odds (-105) provides mathematical edge. |
| Detroit Pistons @ Cleveland Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Over | Over 227.5 | -110 | 3 units | Both teams projected with above-average offensive efficiency. The total is modestly priced considering the pace potential, and Cavaliers' games often hit overs when installed as road favorites. |

Remember to always practice responsible gambling and consider these recommendations as part of a broader betting strategy rather than individual wagers.
