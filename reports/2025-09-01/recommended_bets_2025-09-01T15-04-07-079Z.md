## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 units | Significant pricing discrepancy between FanDuel (-190) and DraftKings (-218). Denver historically dominates at home after Christmas, and this 28-point line difference creates substantial value. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +10 | -105 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Christmas showcase games tend to be more competitive than regular season matchups. Getting double-digits with the Spurs offers value, especially with the half-point advantage over FanDuel's line (9.5). |
| Houston Rockets vs Golden State Warriors (11/27/2025) | Spread | Rockets +1 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Curious line inconsistency - Rockets are actually moneyline favorites (-115) yet can be taken with +1 points on the spread, creating a clear mathematical edge. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Dallas Mavericks (10/23/2025) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Texas rivalry with essentially pick'em moneyline (-110 both teams) but spread advantage to Spurs, creating positive expected value in what bookmakers view as an even matchup. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/25/2025) | Total | Under 229.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Christmas Day games frequently feature heightened defensive intensity and lower scoring than regular season averages. Both teams likely to emphasize half-court execution in this high-profile matchup. |

These recommendations are based on identifying mathematical advantages and situational betting edges rather than team composition specifics, as current lineup and injury information is unavailable for future games.
