## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Spread | Team trailing at halftime | -110 | 3 | With a pick'em spread (-1/-105 for Mavs), whichever team falls behind by 6+ points would present significant value as momentum typically swings in close matchups |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings | Moneyline | Kings | -102 | 2 | With near even odds in a competitive matchup, the Kings offer slight value. In live scenarios, if Suns take an early lead, Kings ML value increases significantly |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26) | Spread | Timberwolves | +4.5 (-112) | 3 | FanDuel's line offers better value than DraftKings (+5). If Nuggets build an early lead, look for enhanced value on the Wolves who typically close strong |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers | Total | Under 222 | -110 | 4 | If game starts with hot shooting and live total moves up, there's value on the under as these defensive teams typically tighten up in competitive second halves |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets | Moneyline | Team trailing after Q1 | Varies | 2 | With a 1-point spread, this projects as highly competitive. The team trailing after the first quarter typically presents value as variance normalizes |

Remember that with live betting, timing is crucial. Look for momentum shifts, foul trouble situations, and shooting variance to identify the optimal entry points for these recommended positions.
