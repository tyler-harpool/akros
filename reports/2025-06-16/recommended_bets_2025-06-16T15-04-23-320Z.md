## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | OKC's defensive identity anchored by Holmgren plus SGA's offensive dominance should allow them to control this game at home against a Pacers team that can struggle defensively. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 224.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | Thunder's top-tier perimeter and interior defense should disrupt Haliburton's playmaking and limit the Pacers' transition opportunities, leading to a lower-scoring affair. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 (DraftKings) | 1 | Small value play at these odds - if Pacers can push pace and Haliburton/Siakam get hot from outside, they have upset potential that exceeds the implied 23% win probability. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -4.5 | -200 (BetMGM) | 4 | Higher probability but lower payout bet that still offers value - Thunder should win but the full 9.5 points carries more risk if Pacers shooters get hot. |

These recommendations balance potential return with probability based on the matchup dynamics. The Thunder should control this game, but Indiana's offensive ceiling provides some contrarian betting value at long odds.
