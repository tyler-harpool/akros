Let's analyze the provided betting opportunities for the upcoming Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game. I'll consider the available betting lines, assess potential value, and formulate recommendations.

# Game Context
The game is Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers scheduled for 6/17/2025, 12:35:00 AM. This is a live in-game betting analysis, so I should focus on current game state, momentum, and recent events.

However, I notice that the information provided is somewhat limited:
- No current game state information (score, quarter, time remaining)
- No lineup data available for either team
- No key injuries listed
- No statistical edges detected according to the analysis

# Betting Lines Analysis

Let's analyze the available lines across the three bookmakers:

## Moneyline
- DraftKings: Thunder -380, Pacers +300
- FanDuel: Thunder -405, Pacers +320
- BetMGM: Thunder -450, Pacers +333

The Thunder are heavy favorites across all bookmakers. The best price for the Thunder is at DraftKings (-380), while the best price for the Pacers is at BetMGM (+333).

## Spread
- DraftKings: Thunder -9.5 (-105), Pacers +9.5 (-115)
- FanDuel: Thunder -9.5 (-110), Pacers +9.5 (-110)
- BetMGM: Thunder -9.5 (-110), Pacers +9.5 (-110)

The spread is consistent at 9.5 points across all bookmakers, with slight variations in the juice. DraftKings offers the best value for betting on the Thunder to cover (-105).

## Totals
- DraftKings: 223.5 (-110 both sides)
- FanDuel: 224 (-110 both sides)
- BetMGM: 223.5 (Over -115, Under -105)

The totals line is fairly consistent at 223.5 to 224 points. BetMGM offers the best value for the Under at -105.

# Live Betting Considerations

Since this is live in-game betting, I would normally consider:
1. Current score and time remaining
2. Momentum shifts
3. Foul trouble
4. Shooting performances (hot/cold streaks)
5. Lineup adjustments
6. Pace of play

However, without specific live game information, I'll need to make some assumptions and focus on the odds discrepancies across bookmakers.

# Bet Recommendations

Without specific game state information, I'll recommend bets based on the odds variations and general betting principles for live NBA games:

1. **Value on the Pacers Moneyline (BetMGM +333)**: When a team is a heavy underdog (9.5 points), there's often value on their moneyline, especially in live betting situations where momentum can shift quickly.

2. **Thunder -9.5 at DraftKings (-105)**: If the Thunder are indeed dominating, the -105 juice at DraftKings offers better value than the -110 at other books.

3. **Under 223.5 at BetMGM (-105)**: The best price on the Under is at BetMGM. In live betting, Unders often have value as games can slow down in later stages.

4. **Pacers +9.5 at FanDuel (-110)**: If the game is competitive, the Pacers covering a 9.5-point spread could be valuable. FanDuel and BetMGM offer the same odds, but I'll choose FanDuel for this recommendation.

# Stake Sizing

Without specific game state information, I'll assign moderate stakes (2-3 units) to these recommendations.

Let me organize these into the required format:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +333 | 2 | Best value on Pacers ML across books; high potential ROI for live underdog |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -105 | 3 | Best price on Thunder spread; value compared to -110 elsewhere |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -105 | 3 | Best price on Under; live games often trend under as defenses adjust |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -110 | 2 | Hedge position if game remains competitive |

However, I want to note that without specific game state information, these recommendations have limitations. In a true live betting scenario, the current score, time remaining, and momentum would be crucial factors in making more precise recommendations.
