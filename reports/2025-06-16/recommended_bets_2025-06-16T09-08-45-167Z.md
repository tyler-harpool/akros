## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 | The Pacers' offensive firepower with Haliburton and Siakam should allow them to keep this game within single digits, even in a loss. Their pace of play creates extra possessions that help underdogs cover. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 224.5 | -110 | 4 | The Pacers' up-tempo style combined with both teams' scoring talent should push this game over the total. Indiana regularly forces opponents to play faster, and the Thunder have enough offensive weapons to capitalize. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -400 | 2 | While the odds don't offer tremendous value, the Thunder's home-court advantage and superior two-way lineup should secure a victory. This is a safer play with reasonable return as part of a broader betting strategy. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -190* | 3 | Reducing the spread requirement for the Thunder increases the probability of success while still offering better value than the moneyline. SGA and Holmgren should provide enough scoring to maintain a modest lead. |
