## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +333 | 1 | Best value on underdog at BetMGM if Pacers are showing signs of momentum shift that hasn't yet been priced into the line |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | -110 | 2 | Shop the highest total at BetMGM; value if defenses are tightening in late-game situations |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -105 | 2 | Best spread value at DraftKings; worth taking if Thunder are showing dominance with key players performing well |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Pacers +5.5 | +175* | 1 | *Estimated odds for alternative spread; recommended if game is competitive but line hasn't adjusted |

Note: With limited live game information, these recommendations are based on potential scenarios. For optimal live betting, I would need current score, time remaining, and recent performance data to provide more precise recommendations.
