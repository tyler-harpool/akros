Now, let's analyze this game from different perspectives:

### Team Strengths and Weaknesses

Oklahoma City Thunder:
- They are heavily favored in this matchup with -9.5 spread
- Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is their star player and likely one of the best players in the league
- They have a strong defensive frontcourt with Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein
- Luguentz Dort is known as a strong defensive guard

Indiana Pacers:
- Tyrese Haliburton is their primary playmaker
- Pascal Siakam provides scoring and versatility
- Myles Turner offers rim protection and spacing
- They typically play at a fast pace under Rick Carlisle's coaching style

### Betting Analysis

The market is heavily favoring the Thunder in this matchup, with a 9.5-point spread across all sportsbooks. This suggests the Thunder are considered significantly better than the Pacers.

Moneyline Analysis:
- The Thunder's moneyline ranges from -405 to -425, implying about an 80-81% win probability
- The Pacers' moneyline is between +320 and +330, suggesting a 23-24% win probability
- There's a slight edge in the market with the total implied probability exceeding 100% (as expected with the vig)

Spread Analysis:
- The 9.5-point spread is consistent across all bookmakers
- DraftKings and FanDuel have the same juice (-108/-112) while BetMGM offers slightly better value on the Thunder (-105) but worse on the Pacers (-115)

Totals Analysis:
- The total points line is 224.5 on FanDuel and BetMGM, and 225 on DraftKings
- Standard -110 juice across all books

Since no significant edges were detected in the betting markets according to the analysis provided, we need to look for potential value based on our understanding of the matchup.

### Game Dynamics

Both teams have strong starting lineups. The Thunder have excellent defenders in Dort, Holmgren, and Hartenstein to potentially slow down the Pacers' offense. However, the Pacers have good offensive firepower with Haliburton, Siakam, and Turner's ability to stretch the floor.

The Pacers typically play at a faster pace, which could push the total higher if they can dictate the tempo. However, the Thunder's defense might be able to slow them down.

The 9.5-point spread suggests a comfortable Thunder win is expected. Given that they're at home and appear to have the superior roster led by SGA, this seems reasonable. However, spread bets of this size can be volatile.

### Recommended Bets

Based on the analysis, here are the potential bets that might offer value:

1. **Thunder -9.5 at BetMGM (-105)**: This offers the best odds for the Thunder spread, and given their apparent advantage, they could cover this spread at home.

2. **Under 224.5 points at FanDuel or BetMGM (-110)**: If the Thunder's defense is as strong as their lineup suggests, they might be able to slow down the Pacers' typically fast-paced offense.

3. **Pacers +9.5 at DraftKings or FanDuel (-112)**: If we think the spread is too large, betting on the Pacers to keep it close could be valuable.

4. **Over 225 at DraftKings (-110)**: If the Pacers can successfully push the pace against the Thunder, this could go over.

5. **Pacers Moneyline at DraftKings (+330)**: This is a higher-risk bet, but if there's a chance the Pacers can pull off the upset, the payoff is significant.

Let me consider which of these bets I believe offer the most value, taking into account the team matchups and historical performance:

1. **Thunder -9.5 at BetMGM (-105)**: The Thunder have the best value for the spread at BetMGM with -105 odds. Given their strong lineup and home-court advantage, they could potentially cover this spread. I would give this a 3/5 unit stake.

2. **Under 224.5 points at FanDuel or BetMGM (-110)**: The Thunder's defensive capabilities with Holmgren, Hartenstein, and Dort could slow down the Pacers' offense. This might be a good bet if we expect a defensive game. I would give this a 2/5 unit stake.

3. **Pacers +9.5 at DraftKings or FanDuel (-112)**: While the Thunder are favored, 9.5 points is a significant spread. If the Pacers can keep it competitive, this could be valuable. I would give this a 2/5 unit stake.

4. **Pacers Moneyline at DraftKings (+330)**: This is a high-risk, high-reward bet. The Pacers are clear underdogs but if they can pull off the upset, the payoff is substantial. Given the long odds, I would only recommend a 1/5 unit stake.

These recommendations balance different possible outcomes of the game and provide options based on different views of how the matchup might play out.

Final Recommendations:
1. Thunder -9.5 at BetMGM (-105) - 3 units
2. Under 224.5 points at FanDuel (-110) - 2 units
3. Pacers +9.5 at DraftKings (-112) - 2 units
4. Pacers Moneyline at DraftKings (+330) - 1 unit

Note: I've only kept the bets that seem to offer the most value, and I've assigned stake sizes based on the perceived confidence in each bet.

Actually, I've made a mistake here. I can't recommend both Thunder -9.5 and Pacers +9.5 as these are directly opposing bets. Let me reconsider my recommendations.

I should pick a side on the spread rather than recommending both. Based on the lineups and the fact that the Thunder are at home with a stronger roster on paper, I'm more inclined to recommend the Thunder -9.5, especially at the better -105 odds at BetMGM.

For the totals bet, I'm leaning toward the Under 224.5 given the Thunder's defensive capabilities.

As for the moneyline, while the Pacers at +330 offers a potentially high return, the risk might be too great given the Thunder's advantages. However, it could be a small-stake flyer if someone wants to bet on an upset.

So my revised recommendations would be:

1. Thunder -9.5 at BetMGM (-105) - 3 units
2. Under 224.5 points at FanDuel or BetMGM (-110) - 2 units
3. Pacers Moneyline at DraftKings (+330) - 1 unit

These provide a mix of higher-probability bets (the spread and total) along with a higher-risk, higher-reward option (the Pacers moneyline).

Let me provide clear reasoning for each:

1. **Thunder -9.5 at BetMGM (-105) - 3 units**: The Thunder have the strongest odds value for the spread at BetMGM. With their defensive prowess and star power in SGA, they should be able to control this game at home and potentially win by double digits.

2. **Under 224.5 points at FanDuel or BetMGM (-110) - 2 units**: The Thunder's defensive strength with Holmgren, Hartenstein, and Dort should help contain the Pacers' offense. While the Pacers prefer to play at a faster pace, the Thunder's defense may slow them down enough to keep the total under.

3. **Pacers Moneyline at DraftKings (+330) - 1 unit**: This is a high-risk bet, but the Pacers have the offensive talent with Haliburton, Siakam, and Turner to potentially pull off an upset. At +330 odds, there's value in placing a small stake on this outcome.

Another option to consider is alternate spread or alternate totals markets, but those weren't provided in the betting lines data. Given what we have, these three bets represent a balanced approach to this game.

Additionally, I'll note that without specific information about injuries, recent form, or head-to-head matchups, these recommendations are based primarily on the lineups and general team strengths as described. The staking amounts reflect the level of confidence in each bet.
