## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 3 | Despite Thunder's superiority, 9.5 points is a significant cushion in the NBA. Pacers' offensive firepower can keep this within single digits. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 224.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Pacers play at a faster pace, and both teams have enough offensive weapons to push this over. DraftKings offers slightly better value than other books. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +340 (BetMGM) | 1 | Low-probability but high-value flier. BetMGM offers the best odds for an upset. Worth a small stake if Haliburton gets hot. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Thunder's elite defense can potentially stifle Pacers' offense at home. SGA's scoring prowess could lead to a comfortable win. |

These recommendations balance finding value in the markets while acknowledging Oklahoma City's status as heavy favorites. The stakes reflect varying confidence levels based on probability and potential return.
