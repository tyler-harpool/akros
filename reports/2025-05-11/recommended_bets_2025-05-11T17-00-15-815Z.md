## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 | 3 | Both teams feature strong defensive units when locked in. Denver's home games tend to be lower scoring in competitive situations, and the Nuggets will likely slow the pace to neutralize OKC's transition offense. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -110 | 4 | Indiana's home-court advantage is significant with their uptempo style. The Pacers have the offensive firepower to keep this game close, especially with Haliburton distributing and Siakam as a scoring threat. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 199.5 | -110 | 3 | Minnesota's elite defense combined with what will likely be a playoff-like atmosphere should produce a lower-scoring game. The Wolves have consistently suppressed opponents' scoring this season. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Pacers | +180 | 2 | While Cleveland has the edge in overall talent, the value at +180 for Indiana at home is appealing. The Pacers' fast-paced offense can give Cleveland's defense problems, making this an attractive underdog play. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 208.5 | -110 | 2 | Expect a physical, defensive-oriented game at MSG. The Knicks typically play at a slower pace, and these Atlantic Division rivals know each other well, which should lead to a lower-scoring affair. |

Remember to practice responsible gambling and never wager more than you can afford to lose.
