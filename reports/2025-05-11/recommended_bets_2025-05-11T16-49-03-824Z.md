## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 4 | Denver's championship core remains intact, and the spread appears too wide for a home playoff game with JokiÄ‡'s playoff experience. BetMGM offers the best value with -105 juice. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +220 (BetMGM/FanDuel) | 2 | While riskier, there's significant value on the defending champions at home with odds implying just a 31% win probability. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 | This is the lowest total of all games with Minnesota's elite defense likely to dictate pace. The Warriors' home games against defensive teams often trend under. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 208.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Playoff basketball at MSG typically features increased defensive intensity. Both teams have strong defenders who can disrupt offensive flow, and BetMGM offers the best price. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | DraftKings offers the best line at +5 compared to +5.5 elsewhere. The Pacers' home-court advantage and typically strong offensive showing at home provides some cushion against this spread. |
