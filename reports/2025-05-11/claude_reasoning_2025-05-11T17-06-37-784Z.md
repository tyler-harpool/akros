Let's analyze each of the four NBA games for May 11-13, 2025, to identify the best betting opportunities. I'll examine the matchups, lineups, odds, and any relevant context to make well-reasoned recommendations.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/11/2025)

Starting with the odds analysis:
- Moneyline: Denver is favored at home with odds around -270 (implying ~73% win probability)
- Spread: Denver -6.5 to -7 points
- Total: 228-228.5 points

Lineup analysis:
- Denver has their championship core intact with Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr., and Gordon
- OKC has their young star lineup with SGA, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, and Hartenstein

Denver has the advantage of playoff experience and Jokic is likely the best player on the floor. However, OKC has shown tremendous growth with their young core. The 7-point spread seems a bit wide for a playoff game between two quality teams. 

The total of 228.5 points is interesting. Both teams play different styles - Denver prefers a more methodical pace with Jokic orchestrating, while OKC can push in transition with their youth and athleticism.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (5/12/2025)

Odds analysis:
- Moneyline: Cleveland favored at around -215 (implying ~68% win probability)
- Spread: Cleveland -5 to -5.5 points
- Total: 230.5-231 points

Lineup analysis:
- Cleveland has their core lineup with Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, and Allen
- Indiana has Haliburton, Siakam, Turner, and complementary players

This is a contrast in styles - Indiana typically plays at a very fast pace with Haliburton leading their transition offense, while Cleveland can be more halfcourt oriented with their two guards. The high total suggests oddsmakers are expecting Indiana's pace to dictate the game flow.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/12/2025)

Odds analysis:
- Moneyline: Boston favored at around -250 (implying ~71% win probability)
- Spread: Boston -6.5 points
- Total: 208.5-209 points

Lineup analysis:
- No specific lineup information is provided for either team
- In reality, Boston would likely have their core of Tatum, Brown, Holiday, Horford, and White
- Knicks would have Brunson, Anunoby, Randle (if healthy), DiVincenzo, and others

The lower total reflects the typically defensive-oriented games when these teams meet. The spread is substantial at 6.5 points, suggesting Boston is viewed as significantly better.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/13/2025)

Odds analysis:
- Moneyline: Minnesota favored at around -215 (implying ~68% win probability)
- Spread: Minnesota -5.5 points
- Total: 199.5-200.5 points

Lineup analysis:
- No specific lineup information is provided for either team
- Warriors would likely have Curry, Thompson, Wiggins, and Green
- Timberwolves would have Towns, Edwards, Gobert, and others

This game has the lowest total by far at around 200 points, suggesting a defensive battle or slower pace. Minnesota being favored by 5.5 points on the road in Golden State is noteworthy, as the Warriors typically maintain a strong home-court advantage.

Now, let me identify the most promising betting opportunities based on this analysis:

1. **OKC +7 vs. Denver**: The Thunder are a talented team, and 7 points seems like a large spread for a playoff game between two quality Western Conference teams. While Denver has the experience edge, OKC has enough talent with SGA, Holmgren, and others to keep this competitive.

2. **Pacers/Cavs Over 231**: With Indiana's pace and both teams having strong offensive talent, the over could be valuable. Indiana's games typically feature high scoring, especially at home.

3. **Knicks +6.5 vs. Celtics**: Playoff games at Madison Square Garden typically feature a strong home-court advantage. While Boston is the better team on paper, the Knicks' physical style could keep this game closer than 6.5 points.

4. **Warriors/Timberwolves Under 200.5**: This total is already low, but Minnesota's elite defense with Gobert protecting the rim could make this a grind-it-out affair.

5. **Warriors +5.5 vs. Timberwolves**: Golden State as a 5.5-point home underdog seems like value, considering their championship experience and home-court advantage.

Now I'll structure these into specific recommendations with stakes based on my confidence level.
