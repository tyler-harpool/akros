Let me analyze each game systematically to determine the best betting opportunities based on the provided information.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

First, let's look at the available betting options:

**Moneyline:**
- Denver (Home): +210 to +220 across bookmakers
- OKC (Away): -258 to -275 across bookmakers

**Spread:**
- Denver: +6.5 to +7 points
- OKC: -6.5 to -7 points

**Totals:**
- 227.5 to 228.5 points

**Lineups:**
The provided lineups show both teams at relatively full strength:

Thunder have their core of SGA, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, and Hartenstein starting.
Nuggets have their championship core of Murray, Braun, Porter, Gordon, and Jokić starting.

There don't appear to be any major injuries noted.

**Game Context Analysis:**
- This appears to be a playoff matchup between the defending champion Nuggets and the rising Thunder.
- The odds imply that OKC is a significant favorite despite playing in Denver.
- This is surprising given Denver's home court advantage and playoff experience.
- The spread of 6.5-7 points feels large for what should be a competitive playoff game between quality teams.

**Value Assessment:**
- The moneyline for Denver at home (+210 to +220) seems to offer value, especially with the Nuggets' playoff experience and Jokić's dominance.
- The spread at +6.5 (-105) from BetMGM also looks favorable for Denver.
- The total of 227.5-228.5 seems reasonable for these teams, but without recent scoring trends, it's harder to assess value.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

**Moneyline:**
- Indiana (Home): +170 to +180
- Cleveland (Away): -205 to -220

**Spread:**
- Indiana: +5 to +5.5 points
- Cleveland: -5 to -5.5 points

**Totals:**
- 230.5 to 231 points

**Lineups:**
No lineup information is provided for this game.

**Game Context Analysis:**
- Without lineup information, I have limited context for this matchup.
- The odds suggest Cleveland is a solid favorite even on the road in Indiana.
- The high total (230.5-231) suggests an expected fast-paced, high-scoring game.

**Value Assessment:**
- Without lineup information, injury updates, or recent performance data, it's difficult to identify clear value opportunities.
- The 5-5.5 point spread from Cleveland is significant for a road team.
- DraftKings offering Indiana +5 (-110) might be more favorable than the +5.5 lines if the Pacers are at full strength.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

**Moneyline:**
- New York (Home): +200 to +215
- Boston (Away): -250 to -260

**Spread:**
- New York: +6.5 points consistently across bookmakers
- Boston: -6.5 points

**Totals:**
- 208.5 to 209 points

**Lineups:**
No lineup information is provided for this game.

**Game Context Analysis:**
- Boston is a significant favorite even on the road at Madison Square Garden.
- The relatively low total (208.5-209) suggests an expected defensive battle.
- Without lineup information, it's difficult to assess the full context.

**Value Assessment:**
- The consistent 6.5-point spread across all bookmakers suggests market consensus.
- The total of 208.5 with BetMGM offering -105 for the Under could be of interest if key defensive players are active.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

**Moneyline:**
- Golden State (Home): +170 to +184
- Minnesota (Away): -210 to -220

**Spread:**
- Golden State: +5.5 points consistently across bookmakers
- Minnesota: -5.5 points

**Totals:**
- 199.5 to 200.5 points

**Lineups:**
No lineup information is provided for this game.

**Game Context Analysis:**
- Minnesota is favored on the road in Golden State, which is notable given the Warriors' historical home court advantage.
- The very low total (199.5-200.5) suggests an expected defensive battle or slow pace.
- This is the lowest total among all four games being analyzed.

**Value Assessment:**
- BetMGM offering Warriors +5.5 (-115) could be of interest if the Warriors have their core players available.
- The Under 200.5 (-110) with FanDuel might offer value in what's projected to be a lower-scoring game.

# Summary of Potential Value Bets

Based on the limited information provided, here are the bets that appear to offer the most value:

1. **Denver Nuggets +6.5 (-105)** with BetMGM - The Nuggets are defending champions with a strong home court advantage and their core lineup intact. The spread seems too large.

2. **Denver Nuggets ML (+220)** with FanDuel - While riskier, this offers significant value for a home playoff game with the defending champions.

3. **Under 200.5 (-110)** for Warriors vs Timberwolves with FanDuel - This is the lowest total across all games, suggesting defensive play is expected.

4. **Under 208.5 (-105)** for Knicks vs Celtics with BetMGM - If this is a playoff matchup, defensive intensity typically increases.

5. **Warriors +5.5 (-105)** with BetMGM - If the Warriors are at full strength at home, this spread may be too generous.

Given the lack of complete information on lineups, injuries, and recent performance for most teams, my confidence levels for these bets would vary. I'd recommend smaller stakes (1-3 units) rather than maximum stakes until more information becomes available.

Now, let me re-evaluate these based on the limited information we have and make my final 3-5 recommendations in the required format.

Actually, before I finalize, let me double check something. I notice that the moneyline odds for Denver are around +210 to +220, which would mean they're the underdogs at home. This seems unlikely given they're the defending champions, so I should check if I'm interpreting the home/away teams correctly.

Looking at the data again:

```
## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
Game Start: 5/11/2025, 2:35:00 PM

### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 210 | -258 |
| FanDuel | 220 | -270 |
| BetMGM | 220 | -275 |
```

This suggests Denver (home team) is at +210, +220, etc., while OKC (away team) is at -258, -270, etc.

But looking at the lineup information:

```
## Oklahoma City Thunder @ Denver Nuggets
Game starts at 3:30 PM ET
```

This format (X @ Y) typically means X is the visiting team and Y is the home team. So Denver should be the home team here.

Something isn't aligning properly. If Denver is the home team, then the positive moneyline odds (+210, etc.) would mean they're underdogs at home, which is unusual for the defending champions.

Let me recheck the spreads as well:

```
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 6.5 (-110) | -6.5 (-110) |
| FanDuel | 7 (-112) | -7 (-108) |
| BetMGM | 6.5 (-105) | -6.5 (-115) |
```

This suggests the home team (Denver) is getting +6.5 or +7 points, while the away team (OKC) is giving -6.5 or -7 points.

Given this information, I must conclude that Denver is indeed the underdog at home, which is significant. This could be due to:
1. Injuries not mentioned in the lineup information
2. OKC being vastly improved and Denver potentially struggling
3. Some playoff context (perhaps Denver is down in a series)

Let me adjust my analysis based on this understanding:

## Revised Analysis - Denver Nuggets vs OKC Thunder

If Denver is indeed a substantial underdog at home (+210 to +220 moneyline, +6.5 to +7 spread), this suggests strong market sentiment in favor of OKC. The Nuggets' lineup shows their core players (Jokić, Murray, Gordon, Porter) are starting, which makes this line even more surprising.

Without additional context about why Denver is such a significant underdog at home, I can offer two possible interpretations:

1. The market may be overvaluing OKC, creating value on Denver's side (moneyline or spread)
2. There may be important context I'm missing (injuries, fatigue, playoff situation) that justifies these odds

Given that the lineups show both teams at relative full strength, option 1 seems more likely, suggesting potential value in taking Denver as home underdogs.

Let me finalize my recommendations based on all available information:
