Let me carefully analyze the NBA betting opportunities for May 11, 2025, focusing on both live and upcoming games. I'll pay special attention to the Nuggets vs Thunder game that's currently in progress.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (IN PROGRESS)

Let's analyze the current betting lines:

**Moneyline**:
- Denver (home): +250 to +310
- OKC (away): -345 to -450

**Spread**:
- Denver: +7.5 to +8.5
- OKC: -7.5 to -8.5

**Totals**:
- 193.5 to 194.5 points

Since this game is in progress, OKC is clearly ahead by a significant margin based on the live odds. The Thunder are heavy favorites at this point. The total of 193.5-194.5 suggests this is a slower-paced, defensive-oriented game, which is typical for playoff basketball.

Without knowing the current score, time remaining, and other in-game factors, I'll need to make some inferences based on the odds:
- OKC likely has a comfortable lead (perhaps 10-15 points)
- The game is probably in the second half based on the strong confidence reflected in the odds
- The game is trending toward a lower-scoring affair than might have been expected pre-game

The lineups show both teams have their starters playing, with Jokic, Murray, and Porter for Denver against SGA, Holmgren, and Dort for OKC.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

**Moneyline**:
- Indiana (home): +176 to +185
- Cleveland (away): -210 to -225

**Spread**:
- Indiana: +5.5 (consistently across books)
- Cleveland: -5.5 (consistently across books)

**Totals**:
- 230.5 to 231 points

This game has a significantly higher total than the Nuggets-Thunder game, indicating bookmakers expect a fast-paced, high-scoring affair. The Pacers are known for their up-tempo style, and the Cavaliers have been scoring well in recent games. Cleveland is favored by 5.5 points on the road, suggesting they're viewed as the stronger team.

Both teams appear to have their standard starting lineups with no major injury concerns mentioned. Key matchups include Haliburton vs. Garland at point guard and the frontcourt battle between Siakam/Turner and Mobley/Allen.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

**Moneyline**:
- New York (home): +200 to +215
- Boston (away): -250 to -260

**Spread**:
- New York: +6.5 (consistently across books)
- Boston: -6.5 (consistently across books)

**Totals**:
- 208.5 to 209 points

Boston is favored on the road, which isn't surprising given their status as the top team in the East. The 6.5-point spread indicates a significant edge for the Celtics. The total is moderate, suggesting bookmakers expect a relatively controlled tempo.

Unfortunately, we don't have lineup information for this game, which limits our ability to analyze matchups and potential advantages.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

**Moneyline**:
- Golden State (home): +170 to +188
- Minnesota (away): -210 to -225

**Spread**:
- Golden State: +5.5 (consistently across books)
- Minnesota: -5.5 (consistently across books)

**Totals**:
- 199.5 to 200.5 points

The Timberwolves are favored on the road, which speaks to their strength this season. The total is the lowest among the non-live games, suggesting a slower-paced, defensive contest. Without lineup information, it's difficult to assess key matchups, but Minnesota has been known for their defensive prowess this season.

Now let me consider potential betting opportunities:

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (LIVE)

For a live bet, I'd need to carefully consider the current game state. Since OKC is heavily favored at this point, there might be value in the following:

1. If Denver is mounting a comeback but the odds haven't adjusted fully, there could be value in the Nuggets spread.
2. If the game pace has changed significantly (either slowed down further or opened up), there might be value in the total.

However, without knowing the exact game state, I'd be cautious with recommendations here.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

The high total of 230.5-231 suggests a fast-paced game. The Pacers typically play at one of the fastest paces in the league, while Cleveland has been more methodical. If Cleveland can control the tempo, the under might have value. Additionally, the Pacers' home-court advantage in this series could make the +5.5 spread appealing.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

Boston has been the stronger team all season, but the Knicks have been resilient, especially at Madison Square Garden. The 6.5-point spread might be a bit high for a playoff game between these teams. Without lineup information, it's hard to make a strong recommendation, but the Knicks +6.5 could have value if they have their key players available.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

The total of 199.5-200.5 is quite low, reflecting Minnesota's defensive strength. However, if Golden State is at full strength at home, they could push the pace and score more than expected. The Warriors as home underdogs might present value, especially if their key players are all available.

Based on the available information, here are my potential recommendations:

1. For the live Nuggets-Thunder game, I'd need more information on the current state of the game to make a confident recommendation.

2. Indiana Pacers +5.5 vs Cleveland Cavaliers: The spread seems a bit high for a home team in the playoffs, especially with the Pacers' strong home record.

3. Under 231 points in Pacers-Cavaliers: If Cleveland can control the tempo, this game might not reach the high total set by bookmakers.

4. New York Knicks +6.5 vs Boston Celtics: The Knicks have been competitive at home, and playoff games often tighten up, making the spread potentially valuable.

5. Golden State Warriors +5.5 vs Minnesota Timberwolves: The Warriors are experienced playoff performers and could be undervalued as home underdogs.

Let me finalize my recommendations based on the strongest edges I see:

1. Indiana Pacers +5.5 (-110) vs Cleveland Cavaliers - 3 units
   Reasoning: The Pacers are a strong home team with an uptempo style that can keep games close, and the 5.5-point spread provides solid value for a playoff home team.

2. Under 231 points (-110) in Pacers-Cavaliers - 2 units
   Reasoning: Cleveland may try to control the pace to limit Indiana's transition opportunities, potentially keeping the score lower than the market expects.

3. New York Knicks +6.5 (-110) vs Boston Celtics - 3 units
   Reasoning: Playoff games at Madison Square Garden tend to be intense and competitive, and the Knicks have shown resilience all season as underdogs.

4. Golden State Warriors Moneyline (+188) vs Minnesota Timberwolves - 2 units
   Reasoning: The Warriors have championship experience and are dangerous as home underdogs, especially in the playoffs where their experience becomes more valuable.

5. For the live Nuggets-Thunder game, without knowing the current game state, I'd cautiously suggest watching for an opportunity on the Nuggets if they show signs of a comeback, as the market might overreact to the current Thunder lead.

These recommendations balance potential value with risk, focusing on spreads and totals that appear to offer edges based on the available information.
