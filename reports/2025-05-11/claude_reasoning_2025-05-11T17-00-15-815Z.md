Let me analyze each game using the provided information to identify the most promising betting opportunities.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/11/2025)

Looking at the odds:
- Denver is the home team (designated as "Home Team" in the tables)
- Oklahoma City is the away team (designated as "Away Team" in the tables)
- Oklahoma City is the favorite with moneyline odds ranging from -250 to -275
- Spread has OKC favored by 6.5-7 points
- Total points (over/under) is set at around 228-228.5

Lineup analysis:
- Both teams appear to have their key players available
- OKC features SGA, Dort, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and Hartenstein
- Denver has their core of Jokic, Murray, MPJ, and Aaron Gordon

No specific injury information was provided for this matchup.

The odds suggest that OKC is a strong favorite even on the road in Denver, which is notable since Denver typically has a strong home court advantage. This could indicate that one of several things is happening:
1. OKC has been performing exceptionally well
2. Denver might be struggling or fatigued
3. This could be a playoff series where OKC has momentum

The total of 228.5 points suggests an expectation of a relatively high-scoring game.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (5/11/2025)

Looking at the odds:
- Indiana is the home team
- Cleveland is the away team
- Cleveland is favored with moneyline odds ranging from -205 to -220
- Spread has Cleveland favored by 5-5.5 points
- Total points is set at 230.5-231

Lineup analysis:
- Cleveland has their core lineup of Garland, Mitchell, Strus, Mobley, and Allen
- Indiana features Haliburton, Nembhard, Nesmith, Siakam, and Turner

No specific injury information was provided.

Cleveland being favored on the road indicates they're seen as the stronger team. The high total suggests an expectation of an up-tempo game, which would typically favor the Pacers' style of play. This creates an interesting dynamic where the favorite (Cavs) might be playing at the underdog's preferred pace.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/12/2025)

Looking at the odds:
- New York is the home team
- Boston is the away team
- Boston is favored with moneyline odds ranging from -250 to -260
- Spread has Boston favored by 6.5 points across all bookmakers
- Total points is set at 208.5-209

Lineup analysis:
- No lineup data is available for either team

The relatively low total (compared to the other games) suggests expectations of a more defensive contest. Boston being heavily favored on the road in New York is significant, as MSG typically provides a strong home court advantage.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/12/2025)

Looking at the odds:
- Golden State is the home team
- Minnesota is the away team
- Minnesota is favored with moneyline odds ranging from -210 to -220
- Spread has Minnesota favored by 5.5 points
- Total points is set at 199.5-200.5

Lineup analysis:
- No lineup data is available for either team

This has the lowest total of all the games, suggesting expectations of a defensive battle. Minnesota being favored in Golden State is notable given the Warriors' historical home court advantage, indicating that Minnesota is viewed as significantly stronger or that Golden State might be dealing with injury issues.

Now, let me identify the most promising betting opportunities based on this analysis:

1. **Nuggets vs Thunder Total Points**: The total of 228.5 seems high for a playoff matchup (assuming this is a playoff game based on the time of year) between two teams with strong defensive capabilities. Denver games often go under when playing quality opponents, and playoff intensity typically leads to tighter defense.

2. **Pacers vs Cavaliers Home Team Spread**: The Pacers getting 5.5 points at home could be valuable. Indiana plays well at home and their up-tempo style can keep games close, especially with Haliburton orchestrating the offense.

3. **Knicks vs Celtics Under**: The total of 208.5-209 could still be high for what's likely to be a physical, defensive-oriented playoff game. Both teams are known for their defensive capabilities.

4. **Warriors vs Timberwolves Under**: This already has the lowest total at 199.5-200.5, but playoff basketball often features even lower scoring, especially in games with Minnesota's elite defense.

5. **Pacers Moneyline**: At +180, there's potential value in taking the Pacers straight up at home, especially if they can push the pace and leverage their home court advantage.

Let me now formalize my recommendations based on these observations:
