## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder +3.5 | -118 (FanDuel) | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Significant discrepancy from other books' 5.5 spread suggests value, assuming game remains competitive. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Under 230.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Cleveland's elite interior defense with Allen/Mobley can slow Indiana's pace. Best price available across books. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 208.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 1 | Playoff-style basketball tends to be more defensive and deliberate. Best under price available. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 1 | Minnesota's defensive strength should contain Golden State's scoring. Line seems slightly high. |

**Note**: For the live Denver-OKC game, bet recommendation assumes the current game state is reasonably competitive. Reassess based on score and time remaining before placing.
