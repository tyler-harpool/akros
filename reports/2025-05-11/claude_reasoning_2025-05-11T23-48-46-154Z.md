Let me analyze each game and identify the best betting opportunities based on the provided information.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

Looking at the information provided:

- Cleveland Cavaliers appear to be the road favorites with moneyline odds between -220 and -225
- Spread ranges from 5 to 5.5 points in favor of Cleveland
- Total points line is consistently 230.5 across all bookmakers

Both teams have their full starting lineups available. Cleveland features their strong core with Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, and Allen. The Pacers have their own strong lineup with Haliburton, Siakam, and Turner.

The Cavs being road favorites suggests a significant talent advantage. Cleveland likely has the defensive edge with Mobley and Allen protecting the rim. However, Indiana's offense with Haliburton orchestrating could keep this competitive.

The high total (230.5) indicates expectations of a fast-paced, high-scoring game, which typically favors Indiana's style. The Pacers play at one of the fastest paces in the league, while Cleveland traditionally plays slower but has capable scorers.

Looking at the best value:
- The 5-point spread at DraftKings (-112) might offer slightly better value than the 5.5-point spread elsewhere
- For the total, FanDuel offers slightly better odds on the Under at -108
- If backing Indiana at home, FanDuel offers the best moneyline at +184

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

- Boston Celtics are significant road favorites with moneyline odds between -250 and -260
- Spread is consistently 6.5 points across all bookmakers
- Total points line ranges from 208.5 to 209

Unfortunately, we don't have lineup information for either team, which makes this analysis more challenging. Boston being a strong road favorite suggests they're the superior team, which aligns with their typical regular season performance.

The relatively low total (208.5-209) suggests an expectation of a slower-paced, defensive-oriented game. This is typical of playoff basketball, especially in the Eastern Conference.

Looking at the best value:
- For Knicks moneyline, DraftKings offers the best odds at +210
- The spread is fairly consistent across bookmakers
- For the total, BetMGM offers the best odds on the Over at -115

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

- Minnesota Timberwolves are road favorites with moneyline odds between -210 and -225
- Spread is consistently 5.5 points across all bookmakers
- Total points line ranges from 199.5 to 200.5

Again, we don't have lineup information for this game. Minnesota being road favorites against Golden State is notable, as the Warriors traditionally have a strong home-court advantage.

The very low total (199.5-200.5) indicates expectations of a defensive struggle. Minnesota has been known for their defensive prowess, which could explain this low total.

Looking at the best value:
- For Warriors moneyline, BetMGM offers the best odds at +170
- For the spread, BetMGM offers the best odds on the Warriors at +5.5 (-105)
- For the total, FanDuel offers the best odds on the Over at 200.5 (-108)

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

- Oklahoma City Thunder are substantial home favorites with moneyline odds at -500 across all bookmakers
- Spread is consistently 10.5 points across all bookmakers
- Total points line ranges from 220 to 222

Again, we lack lineup information. The Thunder being heavy favorites at home against the Nuggets is surprising given Denver's usual strength, suggesting this might be a situation where Denver is resting players or dealing with injuries.

The total of 220-222 suggests a moderately high-scoring game.

Looking at the best value:
- For Nuggets moneyline, FanDuel offers the best odds at +385
- For the spread, DraftKings and FanDuel offer standard odds at 10.5 (-110)
- For the total, there's variance with FanDuel having the highest line at 222

Now, let me analyze and identify the best betting opportunities across all games:

1. **Indiana Pacers +5 (-108) at DraftKings**
   - This offers slightly better value than the 5.5 spread elsewhere
   - The Pacers are at full strength and playing at home
   - Their fast-paced style could keep this game closer than the spread suggests

2. **Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers Under 230.5 (-108) at FanDuel**
   - Playoff games tend to be lower scoring as defenses tighten
   - Cleveland has strong interior defenders in Mobley and Allen
   - Best odds for this bet are at FanDuel

3. **Golden State Warriors +5.5 (-105) at BetMGM**
   - Warriors historically play well at home
   - This spread with these odds offers the best value
   - Without knowing injury status, this is a moderate-confidence pick

4. **Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves Over 200.5 (-108) at FanDuel**
   - This is a low total by NBA standards
   - Warriors can push the pace at home
   - The odds are slightly favorable

5. **Denver Nuggets +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings or FanDuel**
   - 10.5 points is a large spread for a quality team like Denver
   - Without knowing injury information, this is a lower-confidence pick
   - Standard odds available at multiple bookmakers

Let me now assess the confidence level for each bet to assign stake units (1-5):

1. **Indiana Pacers +5 (-108) at DraftKings** - 3 units
   - Moderate confidence with full lineup information
   - Home court advantage is significant
   - Slight concern about Cleveland's defensive potential

2. **Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers Under 230.5 (-108) at FanDuel** - 2 units
   - Playoff tendency for lower scoring
   - Both teams have capable defenses
   - Risk of high pace from Indiana keeping score high

3. **Golden State Warriors +5.5 (-105) at BetMGM** - 2 units
   - Limited information on lineups
   - Warriors' home court strength is a factor
   - Minnesota has been strong this season

4. **Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves Over 200.5 (-108) at FanDuel** - 1 unit
   - Low confidence due to Minnesota's defensive capability
   - Limited lineup information
   - Low total provides some margin

5. **Denver Nuggets +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings or FanDuel** - 2 units
   - Large spread offers some cushion
   - Limited information on why OKC is such a heavy favorite
   - Nuggets are typically competitive

Now I'll prepare my final recommendations based on this analysis.
