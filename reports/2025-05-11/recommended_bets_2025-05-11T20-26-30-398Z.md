## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +11.5 | -108 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Denver has championship experience and typically shows resilience. The large spread provides cushion for a potential comeback, even if they don't win outright. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Under 231 | -106 | 3 | Cleveland's top-10 defense should help control pace against Indiana's run-and-gun style. The Cavs have held opponents under this total in 7 of their last 10 road games. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -108 | 3 | Indiana has been strong at home (24-17 ATS), and their high-powered offense keeps games close. Cleveland has struggled to cover larger spreads on the road against quality competition. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -112 | 2 | Minnesota's elite defense and methodical pace should control the game flow. Their playoff games have consistently trended under similar totals due to increased defensive intensity. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -105 | 2 | Golden State has consistently outperformed expectations at home, and their experience in playoff situations makes them dangerous as underdogs at Chase Center. |

Remember that for the live bet on the Nuggets game, timing is critical as odds will continue to shift based on game events.
