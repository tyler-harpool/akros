Alright, I'll analyze the provided betting opportunities for the NBA games scheduled for May 11-12, 2025. Let me break down each game considering the available information.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/11/2025)

**Starting Lineups:**
- Thunder: S. Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, J. Williams, Chet Holmgren, I. Hartenstein
- Nuggets: Jamal Murray, C. Braun, M. Porter, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Jokic

**Betting Markets:**
- Moneyline: Nuggets favored (-258 to -275)
- Spread: Nuggets -6.5 to -7
- Total: 227.5-228.5

**Analysis:**
The Nuggets are significant home favorites here, with their core intact led by Nikola Jokic. OKC has a strong lineup with SGA and Holmgren, but Denver has proven playoff experience. The spread of 6.5-7 points seems reasonable given Denver's home-court advantage. The total of around 228 suggests oddsmakers expect a moderately high-scoring game despite both teams having strong defensive capabilities.

BetMGM offers the best value for the Nuggets spread at -6.5 (-115), slightly better than the -7 at FanDuel. For totals, there's a slight discrepancy with BetMGM setting the line at 228.5 versus 227.5 at the other books.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (5/11/2025)

**Starting Lineups:**
- No lineup data available

**Betting Markets:**
- Moneyline: Cavaliers favored (-205 to -220)
- Spread: Cavaliers -5 to -5.5
- Total: 230.5-231

**Analysis:**
Without lineup information, we need to rely on the betting markets to gauge expectations. The Cavaliers are moderate road favorites, suggesting they're viewed as the stronger team. The high total (230.5-231) indicates oddsmakers expect an up-tempo, high-scoring game which aligns with the Pacers' typical playing style.

DraftKings offers the best value for Cavaliers bettors with a -5 spread compared to -5.5 elsewhere. For those looking to back the Pacers, the +5.5 is universal except at DraftKings.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/12/2025)

**Starting Lineups:**
- No lineup data available

**Betting Markets:**
- Moneyline: Celtics favored (-250 to -260)
- Spread: Celtics -6.5 (consistent across all books)
- Total: 208.5-209

**Analysis:**
The betting lines show Boston as significant favorites against New York. The total is notably lower than the other games (around 209), suggesting expectations of a more defensive, grind-it-out contest between these two teams. The consistency of the -6.5 spread across all bookmakers indicates strong market consensus.

FanDuel offers slightly better value for Knicks moneyline at +215, while DraftKings and BetMGM have the best Celtics moneyline at -250.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/12/2025)

**Starting Lineups:**
- No lineup data available

**Betting Markets:**
- Moneyline: Timberwolves favored (-210 to -220)
- Spread: Timberwolves -5.5 (consistent across all books)
- Total: 199.5-200.5

**Analysis:**
Minnesota is favored on the road, suggesting they're viewed as the superior team right now. The total is remarkably low (199.5-200.5), the lowest among all the games, indicating expectations of a defensive battle or slow-paced game. 

BetMGM offers the best value for Warriors backers at +170 on the moneyline and -5.5 (-105) on the spread. For the totals, there's a slight discrepancy with FanDuel having the highest line at 200.5.

Now that I've analyzed each game, let me identify potential value bets based on the information available:

1. **Nuggets -6.5 (-105) at BetMGM**: This offers slightly better value than the -7 spread elsewhere and the -6.5 (-110) at DraftKings.

2. **Cavaliers -5 (-110) at DraftKings**: Getting the Cavs at -5 versus -5.5 elsewhere provides half-point value.

3. **Warriors +170 Moneyline at BetMGM**: This offers slightly better odds than other books for Warriors backers.

4. **Under 228.5 (-110) at BetMGM for Nuggets-Thunder**: With defensive talents on both sides, there's value in taking the highest total line available.

5. **Knicks-Celtics Over 209 (-110) at FanDuel**: Taking the highest available total provides slight value if you expect a higher-scoring game.

Based on these observations and the limited information available, let me formulate my recommended bets:

1. Denver Nuggets -6.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 3 units
   Reasoning: Home court advantage plus their playoff experience and intact core led by Jokic should lead to a solid win. The -105 juice offers better value than other books.

2. Cleveland Cavaliers -5 (-110) at DraftKings - 3 units
   Reasoning: Getting the Cavs at -5 instead of -5.5 offers significant half-point value in what could be a competitive game.

3. Nuggets-Thunder Under 228.5 (-110) at BetMGM - 2 units
   Reasoning: Both teams have strong defensive capabilities, and playoff games often tighten up defensively.

4. Warriors +5.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 2 units
   Reasoning: Golden State at home should keep this competitive, and the -105 juice offers better value than elsewhere.

5. Knicks-Celtics Under 208.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 2 units
   Reasoning: The lowest total with the most favorable odds for what projects to be a defensive-oriented matchup.

Let me organize these into the requested format for my final response.
