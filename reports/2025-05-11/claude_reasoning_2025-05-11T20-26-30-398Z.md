Let me analyze the provided NBA betting opportunities for Sunday, May 11, 2025, with a focus on making smart betting recommendations based on the available information.

# Game by Game Analysis

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (IN PROGRESS)

This game is already in progress, so I need to evaluate the live betting opportunities. From the odds, I can see that:

- The Nuggets are significant underdogs with moneyline odds ranging from +325 to +520
- The spread shows the Nuggets at +10.5 to +11.5 points
- The total points over/under is between 193.5 and 194.5 points

These odds suggest that the Thunder are leading by a significant margin, possibly approaching or exceeding 10 points. The relatively low total points line (under 200) suggests either a defensive game or that scoring has been below expectations so far.

Without specific information about the current score, time remaining, or player performances, I'll need to make some inferences. The fact that the Nuggets are such heavy underdogs in-game suggests they're struggling and the Thunder have established control. The starting lineups for both teams appear to be their typical starters, with the Nuggets having their full-strength lineup including Jokic and Murray, and OKC featuring SGA and Holmgren.

Given the information available, the Nuggets +11.5 points at -108 (FanDuel) might have value if the game isn't completely out of hand yet. Denver is an experienced playoff team that has shown the ability to make comebacks. However, without more specific game state information, this is a moderate confidence pick at best.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

This game hasn't started yet, scheduled for midnight. The Cavaliers are favored by 5.5 points across all bookmakers, with moneyline odds making them clear favorites (-220 to -230). The total points over/under is set around 230.5-231, indicating expectations of a high-scoring game.

The Pacers have been a high-tempo team led by Tyrese Haliburton, while the Cavaliers have a strong defensive foundation with Mobley and Allen but also offensive firepower with Mitchell and Garland. Both projected lineups appear to be at full strength.

The total of 231 points seems high, even for a Pacers game. If the Cavaliers can control the pace somewhat with their defense, the under might have value. Additionally, the Pacers as home underdogs at +5.5 could be worth considering if they've been competitive at home.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

This game is scheduled for tomorrow night. The Celtics are favored by 6.5 points consistently across all bookmakers, with moneyline odds around -250 to -260. The total points over/under is set at 208.5-209, suggesting expectations of a moderate-scoring game.

Unfortunately, we don't have lineup information for either team, which makes analysis more difficult. The Celtics have been the stronger team overall this season and likely will field their standard lineup led by Tatum and Brown.

Without more information about lineups or team form, it's difficult to make a strong recommendation here. The spread and total seem reasonably set based on the expected matchup.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

This game is scheduled for early Tuesday morning. The Timberwolves are favored by 5.5 points across all bookmakers, with moneyline odds making them clear favorites (-210 to -225). The total points over/under is set around 199.5-200.5, indicating expectations of a relatively low-scoring game.

Again, we don't have lineup information for either team. The Timberwolves have been a strong defensive team this season, which likely explains the lower total. 

The Warriors as home underdogs at +5.5 might be worth considering given their strong home court advantage, but without more information about player availability, it's difficult to make a confident recommendation.

# Bet Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, here are my most confident recommendations:

1. **Indiana Pacers +5.5 (-108) vs Cleveland Cavaliers**: The Pacers have a high-powered offense and should be competitive at home. The 5.5-point spread gives some cushion, and FanDuel offers the best odds at -108.

2. **Under 231 (-106) in Pacers vs Cavaliers**: Despite the Pacers' high-tempo style, this total seems a bit high. The Cavaliers' strong defense could slow down the game at times. FanDuel offers the best odds at -106.

3. **Denver Nuggets +11.5 (-108) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (LIVE)**: Without knowing the exact game state, this is a moderate confidence pick. The Nuggets are an experienced playoff team that can make runs to close gaps. FanDuel offers the best spread at +11.5 with odds of -108.

4. **Golden State Warriors +5.5 (-105) vs Minnesota Timberwolves**: The Warriors at home as underdogs could provide value, especially with the best odds of -105 at BetMGM. However, this is a lower confidence pick without lineup information.

5. **Under 200.5 (-112) in Warriors vs Timberwolves**: The Timberwolves have been a strong defensive team, and their games often go under the total, especially against disciplined opponents. FanDuel offers this line at 200.5 with odds of -112.

Let me format these recommendations for the final response with appropriate stakes based on confidence level.
