## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5 | -108 | 3 units | Home court advantage plus Haliburton's playmaking should keep this within 5. DraftKings offers the best line compared to the 5.5 elsewhere. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Under 230.5 | -108 | 2 units | Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and slower pace. Cleveland's elite rim protection with Mobley/Allen should contain Indiana's interior scoring. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -105 | 3 units | Golden State's home court advantage is significant. BetMGM offers the best odds, and Minnesota being road favorites by this margin seems excessive. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +10.5 | -110 | 2 units | Double-digit spreads in playoff matchups provide value, especially with a quality team like Denver. Even if not at full strength, the Nuggets' system keeps games competitive. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Over 200.5 | -108 | 1 unit | While Minnesota brings elite defense, this total is extremely low by modern NBA standards. Warriors' home shooting should push this over the threshold. |

These selections offer the best combination of value and probability based on the available information and current market pricing.
