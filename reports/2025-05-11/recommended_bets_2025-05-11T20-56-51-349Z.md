## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -112 | 3 | Indiana's uptempo style thrives at home where they've been much stronger all season. The 5.5-point cushion offers solid value for a playoff home team with Haliburton orchestrating their offense. |
| Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers | Total | Under 231 | -110 | 2 | Cleveland will likely try to control tempo and limit transition opportunities. Their defensive focus combined with playoff intensity should keep this game under this high total. |
| New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics | Spread | Knicks +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Playoff games at MSG tend to tighten up, and 6.5 points is a substantial cushion in a playoff environment. The Knicks have consistently performed better as home underdogs this season. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves | Moneyline | Warriors | +188 | 2 | Tremendous value on the Warriors as home underdogs given their championship pedigree and playoff experience. Chase Center provides one of the strongest home-court advantages in the league. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +8.5 | -130 | 1 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Despite being behind, the defending champions have shown remarkable resilience in playoff situations. Jokic and Murray have proven they can engineer late-game comebacks. |

When considering these recommendations, remember that playoff basketball often features tighter contests and more defensive intensity than regular season matchups. The home court advantage becomes particularly significant in these high-pressure environments.
