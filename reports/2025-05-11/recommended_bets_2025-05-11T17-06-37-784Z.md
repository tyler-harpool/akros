## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder @ Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +7 | -108 | 3 | OKC's athleticism and SGA's elite play should keep this competitive. 7 points is significant cushion in what should be a close playoff matchup. |
| Cavaliers @ Pacers | Total | Over 231 | -112 | 4 | Indiana's home games consistently push pace and feature high scoring. Haliburton's playmaking combined with both teams' offensive firepower should exceed this total. |
| Warriors @ Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -110 | 3 | Golden State as a 5.5-point home underdog offers value given their championship experience and Curry's ability to elevate in big games. |
| Celtics @ Knicks | Total | Under 209 | -110 | 2 | Playoff intensity typically leads to defensive adjustments and slower pace. These teams' meetings tend to be physical, defensive battles. |
| Pacers @ Cavaliers | Moneyline | Pacers | 180 | 1 | Indiana's home-court edge and fast pace could disrupt Cleveland's game plan. At +180, there's value on the upset potential. |

These recommendations balance value opportunities against probability, with stake sizes reflecting confidence level in each selection.
