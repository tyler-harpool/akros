Let me analyze the betting opportunities for these NBA games, focusing particularly on the live game (Knicks vs Pacers) and the upcoming game (Timberwolves vs Thunder).

## Current Game State Analysis: Knicks vs Pacers (LIVE)

First, I need to understand the current state of the Knicks vs Pacers game. Based on the odds, it appears that the Knicks are heavily favored at this point:

- Moneyline: Knicks -620 to -800 (heavily favored) vs Pacers +400 to +480 (significant underdog)
- Spread: Knicks -3.5, Pacers +3.5
- Total: 224.5 with the Over at -130 and Under at +100

From these odds, I can infer:
1. The Knicks are likely leading by a significant margin since they're heavily favored despite a relatively small -3.5 spread
2. The bookmakers are expecting more scoring (over is juiced at -130)
3. The game is likely in the latter stages, as the moneyline odds are so extreme relative to the spread

Without exact game state information (score, quarter, time remaining), I'll need to be careful with my analysis. The 3.5 point spread suggests the game is still within reach for the Pacers, but the moneyline odds suggest the Knicks are in firm control.

## Upcoming Game Analysis: Timberwolves vs Thunder

For the Timberwolves vs Thunder game:
- Moneyline: Thunder are favored at -138 to -145, with Timberwolves at +118 to +120
- Spread: Thunder -2.5 across all bookmakers
- Total: 217.5 to 218 points

This indicates a relatively close matchup, with the Thunder as modest road favorites. The over/under suggests an average-scoring game by NBA standards.

## In-depth Analysis for Live Game (Knicks vs Pacers)

Given the current odds, I need to carefully consider:

1. **Spread value for Pacers**: The +3.5 spread seems quite small compared to the moneyline odds. This discrepancy could indicate potential value on the Pacers to cover if the Knicks start playing conservatively with a lead.

2. **Game total**: The over is juiced at -130, suggesting scoring has been higher than expected. With the Under at +100, there might be value if I expect the pace to slow down late in the game.

3. **Moneyline considerations**: The moneyline odds for the Pacers (+400 to +480) indicate they have a very small chance of winning outright. Without knowing the exact game state, it's hard to assess if this represents value.

## In-depth Analysis for Upcoming Game (Timberwolves vs Thunder)

For the Thunder vs Timberwolves game:

1. **Home underdog value**: The Timberwolves are home underdogs at +2.5. Home underdogs in the playoffs often provide value, especially in close matchups.

2. **Total points market**: The total is set at 217.5-218 points. Both teams' defensive capabilities might be worth considering here.

3. **Moneyline variations**: There's slight variation in the moneyline odds across bookmakers, with FanDuel offering the best price on Timberwolves (+118) and the best price on Thunder at BetMGM (-138).

## Betting Recommendations

Based on my analysis, I'll now formulate my recommendations:

For the live Knicks vs Pacers game:
1. Consider the Pacers +3.5 if the game is in the late stages and the Knicks are in control but not pulling away. The value here is that teams often play conservatively with leads late in games.
2. The Under 224.5 at +100 offers positive expected value if we believe the pace will slow down in the closing minutes.

For the upcoming Timberwolves vs Thunder game:
1. The Timberwolves +2.5 at -108 (DraftKings) represents decent value for a home team in a close playoff matchup.
2. The Under 217.5 at -105 (BetMGM) might have value if we expect a tight, defensive playoff contest.

Now I'll formalize these into the RECOMMENDED BETS section with appropriate stakes based on confidence levels.

For the Knicks vs Pacers game, without knowing the exact game state, I'll be more conservative with my recommendations but still provide analysis on what appears to be the best value based on the current odds.

For the Timberwolves vs Thunder game, I can be more definitive since we have full information about the upcoming matchup.

Let me put together my final recommendations:

For Knicks vs Pacers (live game):
- Pacers +3.5 (-115) at DraftKings or BetMGM - 2 units
- Under 224.5 (+100) at DraftKings or BetMGM - 3 units

For Timberwolves vs Thunder:
- Timberwolves +2.5 (-108) at DraftKings - 3 units
- Under 217.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 2 units
