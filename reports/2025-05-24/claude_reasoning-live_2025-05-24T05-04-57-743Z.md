Let's analyze the provided NBA betting opportunities for the upcoming games on May 24-26, 2025.

## Games Being Analyzed:
1. Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder (May 25, 2025, 12:30 AM)
2. Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks (May 26, 2025, 12:05 AM)

The request states this is a LIVE in-game betting analysis, but there doesn't appear to be any information about the current game state, score, or in-game developments. Without this crucial information, I'll have to approach this differently than a typical live betting analysis.

Let's start by examining the betting markets for each game to identify potential value.

### Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder

**Moneyline Odds:**
- Oklahoma City (Away): -142 to -150 (favorites)
- Minnesota (Home): +120 to +125 (underdogs)

**Spread:**
- Oklahoma City -2.5 (ranging from -112 to -115)
- Minnesota +2.5 (ranging from -105 to -110)

**Totals:**
- Points: 217.5 to 218
- Over: -110 to -115
- Under: -105 to -110

### Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks

**Moneyline:**
- Indiana (Home): -130 to -135 (favorites)
- New York (Away): +110 (underdogs)

**Spread:**
- Indiana -2 to -2.5 (ranging from -105 to -108)
- New York +2 to +2.5 (ranging from -112 to -115)

**Totals:**
- Points: 223 to 224
- Over: -108 to -110
- Under: -110 to -112

For both games, we don't have lineup information, injury updates, or details about the current in-game situation. This significantly limits our ability to provide accurate live betting recommendations.

In a true live betting scenario, I would analyze:
1. Current score and time remaining
2. Momentum shifts
3. Foul trouble for key players
4. Shooting performance compared to season averages
5. Pace of play and whether it's trending higher or lower than expected

Without this information, I'll need to make some general observations based on the odds provided and what we can infer:

### Minnesota vs Oklahoma City
- Oklahoma City is favored on the road, suggesting they're perceived as the stronger team
- The spread is relatively tight at -2.5, indicating a potentially competitive game
- The total of around 218 points suggests a moderately paced game (not extremely high-scoring but not a defensive slugfest either)

### Indiana vs New York
- Indiana is favored at home by a small margin
- The spread of -2 to -2.5 indicates oddsmakers expect a close game
- The total of 223-224 suggests a higher-scoring game than the Minnesota-OKC matchup

Since we lack in-game information, I'll have to provide somewhat general recommendations based on the available betting lines, looking for the best values across bookmakers.

Now, let's formulate 3-5 betting recommendations based on this limited information:

1. **Minnesota +2.5 at BetMGM (-105)**: This offers the best value for backing the home underdog with a slightly better line than other bookmakers.

2. **Indiana Moneyline at DraftKings/FanDuel (-130)**: If you believe the home favorite will win, this is better than taking the -135 at BetMGM.

3. **Oklahoma City/Minnesota Under 218 at DraftKings (-108)**: The best odds for the under in this game.

4. **New York +2.5 at BetMGM (-115)**: If you want to back the underdog with the additional half-point protection compared to the +2 lines at other books.

5. **Indiana/New York Over 224 at DraftKings (-108)**: The highest total with the best odds if you expect a high-scoring affair.

However, I want to emphasize that without current in-game information, these recommendations are not truly "live" betting suggestions but rather pre-game values based on the odds comparison. For proper live betting analysis, we would need current game state, recent performance metrics, and other real-time factors.

Let me now structure these into the requested format for the response.
