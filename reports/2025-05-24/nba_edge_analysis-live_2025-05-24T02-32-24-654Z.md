## Current Game State Analysis

### Knicks vs Pacers (IN PROGRESS)
Based on the current odds, I can infer that the Knicks have established a significant lead, but the game isn't completely out of reach. The moneyline odds show the Knicks as heavy favorites (-620 to -800), while the spread remains at just -3.5 points. This disconnect suggests the Knicks are leading comfortably, but the Pacers are still within striking distance.

The total of 224.5 with the Over juiced at -130 indicates scoring has been higher than initially expected, and bookmakers anticipate continued scoring at a strong pace.

### Timberwolves vs Thunder (UPCOMING)
This matchup appears very competitive with the Thunder as slight road favorites (-2.5 points). The relatively tight moneyline odds (Thunder -145, Wolves +120) suggest bookmakers view this as a close contest despite the Thunder having the edge. The total of 217.5-218 points indicates expectations for average scoring in what should be a competitive playoff atmosphere.

## Live Betting Opportunities

For the Knicks-Pacers game, the 3.5-point spread compared to the lopsided moneyline creates interesting value. The total being juiced to the over suggests a fast-paced game that could present opportunities on the under if the pace slows late.

For the upcoming Timberwolves-Thunder game, the home underdog situation is always worth examining in playoff basketball, especially with such a small spread.

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +3.5 | -115 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: The moneyline/spread disconnect suggests value. If Knicks are leading comfortably, they may ease up in closing minutes, allowing Pacers to cover this small spread. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | +100 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Even odds on the under provide value, especially if game enters late stages where pace typically slows and defense intensifies. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +2.5 | -108 | 3 | Home playoff underdogs in tight matchups often outperform expectations. DraftKings offers slightly better value than other books. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 2 | BetMGM offers the lowest total line, providing value on the under in what should be a tense, defensive-oriented playoff atmosphere. |

These recommendations balance the uncertainty of live betting with the value presented in current odds structures. For the live game, consider game state and momentum before placing bets, as conditions can change rapidly.
