## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +3.5 | -115 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: The moneyline/spread disconnect suggests value. If Knicks are leading comfortably, they may ease up in closing minutes, allowing Pacers to cover this small spread. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | +100 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Even odds on the under provide value, especially if game enters late stages where pace typically slows and defense intensifies. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +2.5 | -108 | 3 | Home playoff underdogs in tight matchups often outperform expectations. DraftKings offers slightly better value than other books. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 2 | BetMGM offers the lowest total line, providing value on the under in what should be a tense, defensive-oriented playoff atmosphere. |

These recommendations balance the uncertainty of live betting with the value presented in current odds structures. For the live game, consider game state and momentum before placing bets, as conditions can change rapidly.
