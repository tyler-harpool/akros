## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 | Significant value compared to DraftKings' -218 for same bet. Strong home favorite in marquee post-Christmas game. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 | Half-point better than DraftKings spread (-10) with more favorable moneyline odds (-405 vs -455), suggesting market inefficiency. |
| Houston Rockets vs Los Angeles Lakers (12/26/25) | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 3 | Near even moneyline odds (-102/+104) indicate close matchup, making the 1.5 points valuable insurance in what projects as a tight game. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (12/25/25) | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | One-point higher total than DraftKings (225.5) provides better value on the under in a Christmas Day game where defensive intensity often increases. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors (11/15/25) | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 | Excellent price for the short road favorite spread in what the market shows as a near pick'em (both teams at -110 moneyline). |

Note that with future games, these recommendations assume typical roster construction and health. Any major trades or injuries closer to these dates would necessitate reevaluation of these positions.
