## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | -190 | 4 | FanDuel offers significantly better value than DraftKings (-190 vs -218). Denver's championship experience and overall roster quality should give them a clear advantage, making this -190 price undervalued. |
| Boston Celtics vs Detroit Pistons (11/26/25) | Spread | Celtics -1 | -110 | 3 | Spread is remarkably narrow given Boston's projected talent advantage. Even accounting for home court, Boston should be favored by at least 3-4 points against Detroit. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 | 2 | Better price at FanDuel compared to DraftKings (-455). OKC projects as an elite team while Spurs remain in development. Christmas showcase game should highlight OKC's talent advantage. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Mavericks +1 | -102 | 3 | Line suggests these teams are equal with Spurs' home court advantage. Dallas projects to be significantly stronger, making getting a point with the better team excellent value. |
| Orlando Magic vs Miami Heat (10/22/25) | Totals | Under 207 | -110 | 2 | Extremely low total, but justified by both teams' defensive focus and typically slower pace. Early season games often feature stronger defense and less efficient offense. |

These recommendations balance value, probability, and risk appropriately. The stake sizes (1-5 units) reflect confidence level in each selection based on perceived edge and market inefficiency.
