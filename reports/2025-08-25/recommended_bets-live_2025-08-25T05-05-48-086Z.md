## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Thunder -2.5 (live) | -110 | 3 | If Thunder are trailing or in a close game at halftime despite superior shooting metrics and rebounding. OKC's depth tends to wear teams down in second halves, making a comeback/pullaway likely. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Moneyline | Warriors | +136 | 2 | If Warriors are within 5 points or leading in the 3rd quarter with Curry shooting below his season average. Golden State's offense is due for positive regression in this scenario. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Total | Under 222 | -110 | 4 | If the first quarter featured a faster pace than expected but both teams shot poorly (under 45%). This suggests defensive intensity rather than missed open shots, likely continuing throughout the game. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Q4 Spread | Mavericks -1.5 | -102 | 3 | If game remains close entering 4th quarter. Dallas's superior late-game execution and Luka's clutch scoring typically gives them an edge in close finishes against less experienced teams. |
| Suns vs Kings | Live Total | Over 229 | -110 | 2 | If both teams are shooting efficiently (48%+ FG) but the total is trending under due to slower pace or fewer free throws than expected. Tempo likely to increase as game progresses. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as odds shift rapidly based on game events. Always confirm the current game state matches your analysis assumptions before placing these bets, and be prepared to adjust as momentum changes occur.
