## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets @ Minnesota Timberwolves (10/28/2025) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | +102 | 3 | Denver consistently performs well as a road underdog. The minimal spread indicates a virtual toss-up, but getting plus money on the stronger overall team provides excellent value. |
| Philadelphia 76ers @ Boston Celtics (10/22/2025) | Spread | 76ers +2 | -110 | 4 | This Atlantic Division rivalry consistently produces close games. Philadelphia matches up well against Boston, and only needing to lose by 1 point to cover provides significant value. |
| Orlando Magic vs Miami Heat (10/22/2025) | Total | Under 207 | -110 | 3 | This is an extremely low total by NBA standards, but Florida rivalry games tend to be defensive and physical. Both teams traditionally emphasize defense, making this under attainable. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 | The Warriors being home underdogs is noteworthy. Golden State traditionally performs well at home, making this slight underdog position valuable, especially in what projects as a close game. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves @ Oklahoma City Thunder (11/27/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -110 | 2 | This is a relatively large spread between two competitive Western Conference teams. Minnesota has the talent to keep this game close, and eight points provides significant cushion in what should be a competitive matchup. |
