## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers +1 | -118 | 3 units | Lakers historically perform better than expected in "road" games at their shared arena. The even moneyline suggests uncertainty, but Lakers typically draw more fan support in these matchups. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors (11/15/2025) | Moneyline | Spurs | -110 | 3 units | Even odds despite home court advantage for Spurs represents value. San Antonio should benefit from their home environment in what bookmakers view as an even matchup. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 2 units | Warriors getting points as only slight underdogs offers value, especially on a holiday game where experienced teams often outperform expectations. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (11/27/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -110 | 2 units | Large spread between two competitive Western Conference teams. Eight points is excessive given Minnesota's defensive capabilities and star power. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Total | Under 229 | -110 | 2 units | Holiday games between defensive-minded Western Conference teams often play at a slower pace than expected. Both teams emphasize half-court execution over transition opportunities. |

These recommendations represent the best current value based on my analysis of the available betting markets. Stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection, with higher units indicating stronger conviction.
