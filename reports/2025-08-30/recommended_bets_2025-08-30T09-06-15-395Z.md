## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 units | Significant bookmaker divergence (-218 DK vs -190 FD) creates value. Nuggets traditionally strong at home in altitude, especially during holiday period when home court advantage amplifies. |
| Chicago Bulls vs Detroit Pistons (10/23/2025) | Spread | Bulls +2 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Home underdogs in a projected high-scoring game (236.5 total) typically overperform against the spread. Bulls should benefit from home court in what projects as a competitive divisional matchup. |
| Memphis Grizzlies vs Los Angeles Lakers (11/1/2025) | Spread | Grizzlies +1.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Memphis as a home underdog against LA presents clear value. Lakers tend to be overvalued in betting markets due to public money, while Grizzlies perform well as home underdogs historically. |
| Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic (11/26/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | -102 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Home team priced as essentially a pick'em against a typically inconsistent road team. The low total (214.5) suggests a defensive battle where home court advantage becomes more significant. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Total | Under 221.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Thanksgiving night games historically trend under as teams may be fatigued from travel/holiday. This matchup has a surprisingly tight spread suggesting a potentially lower-scoring defensive battle. |

Each of these bets presents a favorable risk/reward ratio based on the current lines. I recommend monitoring injury news and lineup announcements as game dates approach, as these factors could further strengthen or potentially invalidate these edges.
