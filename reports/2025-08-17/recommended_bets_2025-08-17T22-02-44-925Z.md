## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | Significant value discrepancy between bookmakers (FanDuel -190 vs DK -218) for the same bet. Denver historically strong at home, especially in divisional matchups. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/25) | Moneyline | Celtics | -130 | 3 units | Line undervalues Boston's home court advantage in this rivalry. At -130, implied probability is only 56.5% which seems low for the Celtics at home against Philadelphia. |
| Lakers vs Warriors (10/22/25) | Spread | Lakers -3.5 | -110 | 3 units | Spread doesn't fully account for Lakers' home court advantage. Warriors typically struggle more on the road, making this spread value for the home team. |
| Thunder vs Rockets (10/21/25) | Totals | Under 224.5 | -110 | 2 units | Taking the lower total offered by DraftKings creates value. These teams have historically played at a controlled pace against each other, favoring the under. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Mavericks | -110 | 2 units | Even moneyline pricing undervalues home court advantage. With teams viewed as evenly matched by oddsmakers, the home team at -110 offers clear value. |

Remember to always reassess these recommendations closer to game time when lineup information and injury reports become available, as these factors can significantly impact game outcomes.
