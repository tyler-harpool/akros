I need to carefully analyze the live in-game betting opportunities for NBA games. This is a challenging task since I don't have actual live game state information (scores, time remaining, momentum, etc.) which would normally be critical for in-game betting analysis. The data provided shows upcoming games with pre-game odds rather than live betting lines. However, I'll proceed with analyzing the betting opportunities presented and make recommendations based on the information available.

Let's start by examining which games are actually happening today or very soon based on the dates provided, as those would be the most relevant for live betting. The dates in the data range from 2025-2026, which appears to be future games, not current ones. Since these appear to be future games, I'll focus on identifying potential betting value based on team matchups, implied probabilities, and line comparisons between bookmakers.

First, let's look at the closest upcoming games:
1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (10/21/2025, 11:30:00 PM)
2. Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (10/22/2025, 2:00:00 AM)

For these games, I'll analyze the betting lines to identify potential value.

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets Analysis:
- Moneyline: OKC is heavily favored at -265 (DraftKings) and -255 (FanDuel)
- Spread: OKC -6.5 (-110) at both bookmakers
- Totals: 224.5 points (DraftKings) vs 225.5 points (FanDuel)

Converting these odds to implied probabilities:
- OKC ML at -265: Implied probability of approximately 72.6%
- HOU ML at +215: Implied probability of approximately 31.7%

The totals line discrepancy between DraftKings and FanDuel (1 point difference) might offer a small middle opportunity, but it's not significant enough to strongly recommend.

### Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors Analysis:
- Moneyline: Lakers favored at -162 (DraftKings) and -166 (FanDuel)
- Spread: Lakers -3.5 at both books but slight vig difference (-110 DK vs -114 FD)
- Totals: 225.5 (DraftKings) vs 224.5 (FanDuel) - another 1-point difference

Converting these odds to implied probabilities:
- Lakers ML at -162: Implied probability of approximately 61.8%
- Warriors ML at +136: Implied probability of approximately 42.4%

Again, the 1-point difference in totals lines offers a potential middle opportunity, but it's relatively small.

Let's also look at the Christmas Day games since they have more detailed odds information from multiple bookmakers:

### New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (Christmas):
- Moneyline: Knicks favored at -142 at both bookmakers
- Spread: Knicks -2.5 (-110 DK, -108 FD) 
- Totals: 229.5 at both bookmakers but slight vig difference

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (Christmas):
- Moneyline: OKC heavily favored at -455 (DK) vs -405 (FD) - potential value on FD
- Spread: OKC -9.5 at both bookmakers
- Totals: 227 (DK) vs 228.5 (FD) - 1.5 point difference

### Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (Christmas):
- Moneyline: GSW favored at -198 at both bookmakers
- Spread: GSW -4.5 (-112) at both bookmakers
- Totals: 225.5 (DK) vs 226.5 (FD) - 1 point difference

### Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (Dec 26):
- Moneyline: Lakers slightly favored at -118 (DK) vs -122 (FD)
- Spread: Lakers -1 (DK) vs -1.5 (FD) - half-point difference
- Totals: 224.5 (DK) vs 223.5 (FD) - 1 point difference

### Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (Dec 26):
- Moneyline: Nuggets favored at -218 (DK) vs -190 (FD) - potential value on FD
- Spread: Nuggets -5 (DK) vs -4.5 (FD) - half-point difference
- Totals: 229 (DK) vs 230.5 (FD) - 1.5 point difference

Based on the analysis of these lines, I can identify a few potential recommendations:

1. For Oklahoma City vs San Antonio on Christmas, there's a difference in moneyline odds between DraftKings (-455) and FanDuel (-405). If you're backing OKC, the FanDuel line offers better value.

2. For Denver vs Minnesota on Dec 26, the moneyline difference is notable: DraftKings has Nuggets at -218 while FanDuel has them at -190. Again, if backing the Nuggets, FanDuel offers better value.

3. The Lakers/Rockets spread on Dec 26 shows a half-point difference: -1 (DK) vs -1.5 (FD). If backing the Lakers, DraftKings' -1 is preferable; if backing the Rockets, FanDuel's +1.5 is better.

4. There are several small totals discrepancies that could potentially be middled (betting under on the higher line and over on the lower line), but the 1-point differences are relatively small windows.

However, the most important part is that this is supposed to be LIVE in-game betting analysis, but the data provided doesn't include any live game state information. For proper live betting analysis, I would need:

1. Current score
2. Time remaining
3. Recent momentum shifts
4. Live betting odds
5. Key player performance metrics
6. Foul trouble information
7. Lineup changes

Without this information, my recommendations will be limited to pre-game value based on line shopping between bookmakers rather than true in-game value.

Let me formulate the recommended bets based on the information available:

1. Oklahoma City Thunder ML vs San Antonio Spurs (Christmas) - FanDuel at -405 instead of DraftKings at -455
2. Denver Nuggets ML vs Minnesota Timberwolves (Dec 26) - FanDuel at -190 instead of DraftKings at -218
3. Los Angeles Lakers -1 vs Houston Rockets (Dec 26) - DraftKings at -112 instead of FanDuel's -1.5
4. Cleveland Cavaliers +2.5 vs New York Knicks (Christmas) - FanDuel at -112 instead of DraftKings at -110
5. OKC/San Antonio Under 228.5 (Christmas) - FanDuel, paired with potential live bet on Over 227 if score is low early

Since this is meant to be live in-game betting analysis, I should emphasize that these recommendations would need to be adjusted based on the actual game flow, current score, and live odds when the games are being played. Without that information, these are essentially pre-game recommendations based on line shopping between bookmakers.
