## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 | 28-point difference between bookmakers makes FanDuel's -190 significantly better value than DK's -218 for the same bet |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 2 | Half-point spread advantage on DraftKings compared to FanDuel's -1.5, crucial in what projects as a close game |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25) | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 | 4 | Strong value compared to DK's -455 for same bet; Thunder heavily favored against developing Spurs team |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25) | Totals | Over 225.5 | -110 | 2 | Value opportunity with DraftKings offering a full point lower than FanDuel's 226.5 for the over |
| Celtics vs Pistons (11/26) | Spread | Celtics -1 | -110 | 2 | Extremely tight line for defending champion Celtics; strong value against developing Pistons team |

Note: For true live in-game betting, decisions would need to be adjusted based on current score, game flow, momentum shifts, and updated live odds. These recommendations identify pre-game value based on current line comparisons between bookmakers.
