## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | FanDuel offers significantly better value than DraftKings (-218). Nuggets traditionally perform well against Minnesota and the 28-point difference in implied probability creates substantial value. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's -1.5 line provides crucial value in what projects to be a close game. Lakers typically perform well in showcase games after Christmas. |
| Spurs vs Thunder (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 2 | Christmas Day games historically feature competitive performances from underdogs. FanDuel offers better odds than DraftKings, and the large spread provides value for a Spurs team that should be improving. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 3 | Christmas Day games typically feature higher scoring due to national TV spotlight. This total is set 1 point lower at DraftKings than FanDuel, creating value on the over. |
| 76ers vs Celtics (10/31/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | -175 | 2 | Home court advantage in this fierce rivalry game provides value at these odds. Philadelphia traditionally performs well at home against Boston in regular season matchups. |

These recommendations prioritize clear odds advantages, key number spreads, and situational spots where historical performance suggests value opportunities. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection based on the available information.
