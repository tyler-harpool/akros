## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | Significant value compared to DraftKings' -218 for the same bet. Denver historically dominant at home, and FanDuel's line offers 28 points of value. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors (11/15/25) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -115 | 3 units | Home court advantage is undervalued here. Spurs getting points at home suggests a market inefficiency that doesn't properly account for home edge. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/25) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -118 | 3 units | This rivalry game shows Lakers with minimal home advantage in the spread. The Lakers typically perform better in these spotlight matchups and the -1 spread undervalues their home court. |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings (10/23/25) | Spread | Suns -1 | -110 | 2 units | Home team getting only 1 point of advantage signals value. Phoenix should benefit from a stronger home court advantage than this line suggests. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (11/27/25) | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 units | Both teams feature strong defensive capabilities. OKC's home games against Minnesota have historically skewed toward defensive battles, making this total seem inflated. |

These recommendations aim to capitalize on market inefficiencies while maintaining a disciplined approach to bankroll management. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection based on the value identified in the betting lines.
