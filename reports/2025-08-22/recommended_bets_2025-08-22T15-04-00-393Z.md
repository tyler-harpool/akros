## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Rockets @ Thunder (10/21/25) | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Houston's young core of Green and Sengun should be entering their prime years by 2025, making this spread too wide against even a strong Thunder team |
| Spurs vs Warriors (11/15/25) | Moneyline | Spurs | -110 | 4 | By 2025, Wembanyama should be a dominant force in his third season, while Golden State will likely be transitioning from their dynasty era |
| Timberwolves @ Nuggets (12/26/25) | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -108 | 4 | Anthony Edwards should be in his prime as a superstar by this point, making Minnesota highly competitive against Denver, especially with this many points |
| Lakers vs Clippers (11/26/25) | Spread | Lakers +1 | -102 | 2 | The Lakers' organizational advantages in attracting talent should give them an edge in what will be a transition period for both LA teams |
| Rockets @ Warriors (11/27/25) | Spread | Rockets -1 | -110 | 3 | This line suggests Houston will have surpassed Golden State by 2025, and if their development curve continues upward, they should cover this small spread |
