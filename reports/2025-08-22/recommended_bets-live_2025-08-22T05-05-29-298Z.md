## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Houston's perimeter shooting is keeping them competitive despite OKC's talent advantage. Their pace and shot selection suggest they can stay within this margin even if they don't win outright. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 4 | Both teams are scoring efficiently with limited defensive resistance. Warriors' perimeter shooting combined with Lakers' dominance in the paint points to a high-scoring affair. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Moneyline | Mavericks | -110 | 3 | Dallas has established better half-court execution early while limiting San Antonio's transition opportunities. Their veteran decision-making gives them an edge in this evenly-matched contest. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Total | Under 222 | -110 | 3 | Physical defensive play has dominated the early action with both teams struggling to establish offensive rhythm. The rivalry nature of this matchup suggests continued defensive intensity. |
| Suns vs Kings | Spread | Kings +1 | -110 | 2 | Sacramento's depth is creating matchup problems for Phoenix's defense. The Kings' second unit has provided an unexpected scoring boost, making the slight underdog position valuable. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so timing is crucial when placing these bets. Monitor momentum shifts closely and be prepared to act when the odds align with your analysis.
