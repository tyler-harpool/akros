## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Spurs vs Mavericks (10/23/25) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -102 | 4 units | Even moneyline (-110 both sides) but Spurs getting a point suggests market indecision. The -102 price offers excellent value in what's essentially a pick'em game. |
| Warriors vs Nuggets (10/24/25) | Spread | Nuggets +1 | -115 | 3 units | Denver consistently performs well against Golden State. With minimal difference in moneyline prices, getting a point with Denver offers value despite the slightly higher vig. |
| Lakers vs Clippers (11/26/25) | Spread | Clippers -1 | -102 | 3 units | Excellent price on the Clippers as slight favorites. Even moneyline pricing but Clippers laying just 1 point at nearly even money offers significant value in this crosstown rivalry. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Major pricing discrepancy between bookmakers (DK: -218, FD: -190). FanDuel offers significantly better value on Denver in this divisional matchup. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/25) | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | 1.5-point difference between bookmakers (DK: 227, FD: 228.5). Christmas games tend to play at a slower pace, and this total appears inflated on FanDuel compared to DraftKings. |

These recommendations focus on identifying market inefficiencies rather than predicting game outcomes without complete information. Each bet offers positive expected value based on current market pricing.
