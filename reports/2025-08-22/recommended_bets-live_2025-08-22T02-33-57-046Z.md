## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -110 | 3 | If Rockets keep it close through first half, Thunder's superior talent and home court advantage typically leads to a second-half surge that covers this number |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Moneyline | Warriors | +136 | 2 | If Warriors trail by 5-8 points at halftime, their exceptional third-quarter adjustments and three-point shooting capability make them valuable at plus money |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 3 | If first quarter produces 60+ combined points with hot shooting, defenses typically adjust and scoring pace slows in middle quarters |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Total | Over 224.5 | -110 | 3 | If first quarter pace is slower than expected (under 50 combined points), both teams have the offensive firepower to accelerate scoring as the game progresses |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -102 | 4 | In a pick'em situation, the Mavs' superior closing lineup and experience provides significant value if the game remains close entering the fourth quarter |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as odds shift rapidly in response to game events. The most successful live betting strategies involve identifying specific inflection points in games where public perception creates market inefficiencies.
