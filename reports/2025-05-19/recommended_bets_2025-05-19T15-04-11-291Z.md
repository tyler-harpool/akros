## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -110 | 3 units | 7.5 points is excessive in what should be a defensive, low-scoring playoff game between evenly matched teams. Playoff games typically tighten up, making large spreads difficult to cover. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 215.5 | -112 | 3 units | Both teams feature elite defensive personnel and playoff intensity typically reduces scoring. The defensive strengths of these teams should lead to a grinding, half-court game. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4 | -106 | 2 units | FanDuel offers the best value on the Pacers spread. Indiana's up-tempo style and scoring ability gives them a strong chance to keep this competitive throughout. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +158 | 1 unit | The implied 38.8% win probability undervalues Indiana's chances. FanDuel offers the best odds for this calculated underdog play that has legitimate win potential. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 223 | -110 | 2 units | Indiana's pace should create additional possessions, and FanDuel offers the lowest total among sportsbooks (223 vs 223.5), providing slight additional value. |

These recommendations balance risk with potential reward while taking advantage of the best available odds across different sportsbooks for each selection.
