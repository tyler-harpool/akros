## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 214.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best odds for the under across books; playoff matchups between defensive teams often trend lower as games progress |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | Half-point hook provides significant value over other books' +4 lines; playoff underdogs tend to keep games closer than expected |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +152 (FanDuel) | 1 | Best underdog odds available; good value if Pacers are keeping it close or building momentum in the current game state |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Best odds for the favored Thunder across books; home playoff favorites often pull away in second half |

Note: Without current game information, these recommendations focus on finding the best available odds while applying general playoff basketball principles. Adjust stakes based on the current game situation.
