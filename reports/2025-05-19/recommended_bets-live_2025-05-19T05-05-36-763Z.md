## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Live Spread | Thunder -4.5 (when available) | -110 | 3 | If Minnesota starts strong and keeps it within 2-3 points through Q1, look for a reduced live spread on OKC. Thunder have shown excellent ability to make adjustments and pull away in middle quarters at home. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Live Total | Over 215 (when available) | -110 | 3 | If both teams start with defensive intensity and first quarter is low-scoring, the live total will likely drop significantly from the pre-game 223. Both teams have too much offensive talent to stay cold for full games. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Live Moneyline | Timberwolves (if within 5 at half) | +245 | 1 | If Minnesota is competitive through halftime, their live moneyline should offer value. Monitor their defensive effectiveness and three-point shooting as indicators of upset potential. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Live Spread | Pacers +7 (when available) | -110 | 2 | If Knicks build an early double-digit lead, look for an inflated Pacers spread. Indiana has shown they can close gaps quickly with their transition offense and three-point shooting. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Live Total | Under 222 (when available) | -110 | 2 | If early scoring is efficient and pace is faster than expected, the live total will increase. Playoff games typically tighten defensively in second halves as adjustments are made. |

Note: These recommendations are based on anticipated live betting scenarios rather than current in-game situations. Be ready to act quickly when these situations develop during the games.
