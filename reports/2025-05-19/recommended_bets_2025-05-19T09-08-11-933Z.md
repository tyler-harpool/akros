## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Best available odds for this spread; playoff matchups typically tighten as series progress, making large spreads difficult to cover |
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Total | Under 215.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Half-point advantage over other books' 215 line; playoff games often trend lower in scoring due to increased defensive intensity |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | The extra half-point provides crucial value over the +4 available elsewhere; particularly valuable since games often land on common margins like 4 |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Total | Over 222.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Securing the lower total number gives a key advantage; both teams have shown offensive capability and this matchup tends to produce higher-scoring affairs |

These recommendations are based on line shopping advantages across bookmakers, with stakes reflecting relative confidence in each position given the limited contextual information available.
