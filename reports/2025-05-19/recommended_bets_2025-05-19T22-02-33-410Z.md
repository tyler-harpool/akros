## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | BetMGM offers the best price on a Thunder team that is heavily favored at home, providing better value than the standard -110 at other books |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 4 | The Pacers are only moderate underdogs with a tight spread, suggesting value in backing them to keep it close or potentially win outright |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 215.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best odds for the under in a matchup projected to be defense-oriented with a relatively low total baseline |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +158 (FanDuel) | 2 | FanDuel offers the most generous payout on an underdog that's only getting 4-4.5 points, indicating an upset is within reach |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 | With FanDuel setting their line at 223, there appears to be value in taking the higher number at the same odds at DraftKings |

These recommendations balance potential reward with calculated risk based on the available market prices. Without specific lineup information, I've focused on identifying mathematical value in the odds while considering the general game context indicated by the betting markets.
