Let me analyze the current live betting situation for the two NBA games mentioned:

1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves
2. New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

First, I need to understand what information we have and what we're missing:

Missing Information:
- Current game score and time remaining
- Current lineups on the floor
- Recent performance/momentum within the game
- Key injury updates during the game
- Live betting odds that may have shifted from pre-game

Given the limitations, I'll analyze what I can from the provided information:

For OKC vs. Minnesota:
- OKC is heavily favored with moneyline odds around -295
- The spread is OKC -7.5 points
- The total points line is around 214-214.5

For NY vs. Indiana:
- NY is moderately favored with moneyline odds around -180
- The spread is NY -4 to -4.5 points
- The total points line is around 222.5-223

Since this is LIVE in-game betting analysis, I need to be very careful with recommendations without knowing the current game state. However, I can provide some strategic analysis and recommendations based on general in-game betting principles and the odds provided.

For live betting, I would typically consider:
1. How the game flow is developing compared to expectations
2. Key matchups that are working/not working
3. Foul trouble situations
4. Shooting streaks/slumps
5. Lineup adjustments and their effectiveness
6. Pace of play compared to the total line

Since we're missing critical live information, I'll have to base recommendations on more general principles and the odds values provided. I'll also assume these are playoff games given the dates in May 2025.

Let me form my recommendations based on what I can reasonably analyze:

For OKC vs. Minnesota:
- This appears to be a playoff matchup between two Western Conference teams
- The 7.5 point spread suggests OKC is expected to win comfortably
- The total of 214.5 suggests a moderate pace game (not extremely high scoring)

For NY vs. Indiana:
- This appears to be an Eastern Conference playoff matchup
- NY as a 4-4.5 point favorite suggests a reasonably competitive game
- The higher total of 223 points suggests a faster-paced game than the OKC-Minnesota matchup

For live betting recommendations, I'll focus on:
1. Value in the current lines (where odds might be most favorable)
2. General playoff trends for similar situations
3. Line shopping opportunities between different sportsbooks

Since I'm required to make 3-5 specific recommendations without knowing the current game state, I'll have to make some assumptions about typical playoff game dynamics, but I'll be very measured in my approach.
