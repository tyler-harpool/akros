Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the two upcoming NBA games: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers. I'll consider all the available betting lines, though there's no lineup data and injury information provided, which limits some aspects of the analysis.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves Analysis

### Moneyline Analysis
The moneyline odds show OKC as a strong favorite:
- FanDuel: OKC -300, MIN +245
- DraftKings: OKC -305, MIN +245
- BetMGM: OKC -300, MIN +240

These odds translate to implied probabilities of roughly 75% for OKC to win and 25% for Minnesota. This suggests the bookmakers strongly favor OKC at home.

### Spread Analysis
All bookmakers have OKC favored by 7.5 points with standard -110 juice on both sides. The consistency across bookmakers suggests this is a well-established line with no obvious inefficiencies between sportsbooks.

### Totals Analysis
The total points line is set at 215-215.5:
- FanDuel: 215 (-110/-110)
- DraftKings: 215.5 (-108/-112)
- BetMGM: 215.5 (-110/-110)

DraftKings is offering slightly better odds on the over (-108) compared to the other books, and they're also shading the under slightly (-112), suggesting they might be anticipating more under action.

### Game Context
Without lineup data and injury information, I need to rely on broader context. This appears to be a playoff matchup. In the Western Conference, OKC and Minnesota are both strong defensive teams. The Thunder typically have an elite defense led by players like Luguentz Dort and Chet Holmgren, while Minnesota has been known for their defensive prowess with players like Rudy Gobert and Jaden McDaniels.

The relatively low total (215.5) suggests oddsmakers expect a defensive battle. Playoff basketball also tends to be more defensive and lower-scoring than regular season games.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers Analysis

### Moneyline Analysis
The Knicks are favored at home:
- DraftKings: NYK -180, IND +150
- FanDuel: NYK -188, IND +158
- BetMGM: NYK -185, IND +150

These odds translate to implied probabilities of roughly 64% for NYK to win and 36% for Indiana. This is a much closer matchup than the OKC-MIN game according to the odds.

### Spread Analysis
The spread is around 4-4.5 points in favor of the Knicks:
- DraftKings: NYK -4 (-110), IND +4 (-110)
- FanDuel: NYK -4 (-114), IND +4 (-106)
- BetMGM: NYK -4.5 (-105), IND +4.5 (-115)

There's some variance here that could create opportunities. BetMGM has a half-point higher spread than the other books but with more favorable odds for taking the Knicks (-105 instead of -110 or -114). FanDuel is offering better odds (+4 at -106) for taking the Pacers compared to the other books.

### Totals Analysis
The total points line is set at 223-223.5:
- DraftKings: 223.5 (-110/-110)
- FanDuel: 223 (-110/-110)
- BetMGM: 223.5 (-110/-110)

FanDuel has a slightly lower total than the other books, which could create a small arbitrage opportunity if you strongly lean one way on the total.

### Game Context
The Knicks and Pacers are both Eastern Conference teams with contrasting styles. The Pacers typically play at a faster pace with a more offensive focus, while the Knicks under Tom Thibodeau have traditionally been more defensive-minded. However, both teams have evolved, and the higher total (223.5 compared to 215.5 for the OKC-MIN game) suggests oddsmakers expect more scoring in this matchup.

## Identifying Potential Betting Edges

1. **Minnesota Timberwolves +7.5 (-110)**
   - While OKC is favored, 7.5 points is a significant spread for a playoff matchup between two strong teams. Playoff games tend to be closer and more competitive, especially as series progress.
   - Both teams are defensive-minded, which often leads to tighter, lower-scoring games where large margins are less common.
   - Value play on the underdog with a substantial cushion.

2. **OKC-MIN Under 215.5 (-112)**
   - Both teams are known for their defensive prowess.
   - Playoff basketball generally features tighter defensive schemes and slower pace.
   - The under looks appealing given the defensive strength of both teams.

3. **Indiana Pacers +4 (-106) at FanDuel**
   - FanDuel offers the best value on the Pacers spread compared to other books.
   - The Pacers' uptempo style can keep games close, and their offensive firepower gives them a chance to cover or win outright.
   - 4 points is a relatively small spread, so the Pacers only need to keep it competitive to cover.

4. **NY-IND Over 223 (-110) at FanDuel**
   - The Pacers typically play at a faster pace which could lead to more possessions and points.
   - FanDuel offers the lowest total at 223 (vs 223.5 elsewhere), giving a slight edge for over bettors.

5. **Pacers Moneyline +158 (FanDuel)**
   - If you believe the Pacers have a better chance than the implied 38.8% probability to win outright, this offers good value.
   - FanDuel offers the best odds on this underdog play among the three bookmakers.

## Recommended Bets

Based on the analysis above, here are my recommended bets with stakes based on confidence level (1-5 units):

1. **Minnesota Timberwolves +7.5 (-110)** - 3 units
   The large spread in what should be a competitive playoff matchup between defensive teams provides good value.

2. **OKC-MIN Under 215.5 (-112)** - 3 units
   Two strong defensive teams in a playoff setting suggests a lower-scoring affair.

3. **Indiana Pacers +4 (-106)** - 4 units
   Best value across bookmakers for a competitive Pacers team that can keep games close with their offensive output.

4. **NY-IND Over 223 (-110)** - 2 units
   The Pacers' up-tempo style and the Knicks' improved offense this year could push this over the total, with FanDuel offering the lowest number.

5. **Pacers Moneyline +158** - 1 unit
   A small-stake value play on the underdog with the best available odds across bookmakers.
