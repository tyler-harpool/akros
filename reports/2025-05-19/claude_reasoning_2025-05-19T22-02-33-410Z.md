Let's analyze the betting opportunities for these two NBA games by evaluating the available odds, potential edges, and any relevant factors that might influence the outcomes.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/21/2025)

First, let's summarize the odds:

### Moneyline:
- Thunder (home): -295 to -325
- Timberwolves (away): +240 to +260

### Spread:
- Thunder -7.5 (odds range from -105 to -110)
- Timberwolves +7.5 (odds range from -110 to -115)

### Total:
- 215.5 points (all bookmakers agree)
- Over: -110 to -112
- Under: -108 to -110

Looking at these odds, we see the Thunder are significant favorites at home, with a 7.5-point spread across all bookmakers. The total points line is consistent at 215.5 points across all books.

Unfortunately, we don't have lineup information, which makes it harder to analyze potential matchups and advantages. We also don't have any injury reports, which would be crucial for evaluating these lines.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (5/22/2025)

### Moneyline:
- Knicks (home): -180 to -188
- Pacers (away): +150 to +158

### Spread:
- Knicks -4 to -4.5 (odds range from -110 to -114)
- Pacers +4 to +4.5 (odds range from -106 to -110)

### Total:
- 223 to 223.5 points
- Over: -110 (all bookmakers)
- Under: -110 (all bookmakers)

For this game, the Knicks are moderate favorites at home. There's a small discrepancy in the spread (FanDuel has -4 while others have -4.5) and in the total (FanDuel has 223 while others have 223.5).

Again, we're missing lineup and injury information, which limits our analysis.

## Deeper Analysis:

### Thunder vs Timberwolves:
Since we don't have lineup information, I'll need to consider general team dynamics and trends:

1. The 7.5-point spread is significant and suggests the Thunder are strongly favored.
2. The total of 215.5 is relatively low for an NBA game, suggesting the bookmakers expect a defensive battle.
3. The best moneyline value for the Thunder is at FanDuel (-295), while the best value for the Timberwolves is at FanDuel (+240).
4. For spread betting, BetMGM offers the best odds on the Thunder (-7.5 at -105), while FanDuel and DraftKings offer standard -110 on both sides.
5. The total points line is consistent across books, with FanDuel offering the best over odds (-112) and under odds (-108).

### Knicks vs Pacers:
1. The 4/4.5-point spread indicates a closer game is expected.
2. The total of 223/223.5 is higher than the Thunder-Timberwolves game, suggesting a more offensive-oriented contest.
3. The best moneyline value for the Knicks is at DraftKings (-180), while the best for the Pacers is at FanDuel (+158).
4. FanDuel's spread of Knicks -4 (-114) vs Pacers +4 (-106) differs from the -4.5 line at other books, creating a potential middle opportunity.
5. The total points line has a small discrepancy, with FanDuel at 223 and others at 223.5.

## Best Betting Opportunities:

Without detailed lineup and injury information, I'll focus on identifying the best values based on the odds and looking for potential discrepancies between bookmakers:

1. **Thunder vs Timberwolves Spread (Thunder -7.5)**: BetMGM offers the best odds at -105, which is better than the -110 at other books. If you believe the Thunder will cover, this represents the best value.

2. **Timberwolves Moneyline**: If you believe in an upset, FanDuel offers +240, which is better than DraftKings (+245) and BetMGM (+260).

3. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 215.5**: FanDuel offers the best odds at -108, slightly better than the standard -110 at other books.

4. **Knicks-Pacers Spread Middle Opportunity**: Since FanDuel has Knicks -4 while others have -4.5, there's a potential middle opportunity by betting Knicks -4 on FanDuel and Pacers +4.5 on another book. If the Knicks win by exactly 4, both bets would win.

5. **Pacers Moneyline**: FanDuel offers the best odds at +158, compared to +150 at other books.

6. **Knicks-Pacers Total Middle Opportunity**: With FanDuel at 223 and others at 223.5, you could bet Over 223 on FanDuel and Under 223.5 elsewhere, giving you a middle chance if the total lands at exactly 223.

Let me now select 3-5 specific bets that offer the best value based on this analysis:

1. **Thunder -7.5 on BetMGM (-105)**: This offers the best odds for the favored Thunder to cover the spread.

2. **Pacers +4.5 on DraftKings/BetMGM (-110)**: The Pacers getting 4.5 points seems valuable in what is expected to be a closer game.

3. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 215.5 on FanDuel (-108)**: Best odds for the under in a game with a relatively low total, suggesting defensive strength.

4. **Middle opportunity: Knicks -4 on FanDuel (-114) and Pacers +4.5 on DraftKings/BetMGM (-110)**: If the Knicks win by exactly 4, both bets win. If they win by 5+, the Knicks bet wins. If they win by less than 4 or lose, the Pacers bet wins.

5. **Pacers Moneyline on FanDuel (+158)**: Best odds for an underdog that isn't being given a huge spread.

Considering the confidence level for each bet:

1. **Thunder -7.5 (BetMGM, -105)**: 3 units - Good value on odds compared to other books, but large spreads can be risky.

2. **Pacers +4.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM, -110)**: 4 units - Solid value for a game expected to be relatively close.

3. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 215.5 (FanDuel, -108)**: 3 units - Good value on odds, and defensive games are often more predictable.

4. **Middle opportunity (FanDuel/DraftKings/BetMGM)**: 2 units each side - This is a strategic bet that requires the game to land exactly on a specific number, but the risk is managed by having coverage on both sides.

5. **Pacers Moneyline (FanDuel, +158)**: 2 units - Higher risk as they're underdogs, but the payoff is good and the spread isn't huge.

For the final recommendations, I'll format them as requested:

1. **Thunder -7.5 (BetMGM, -105)** - 3 units
   Reasoning: Best odds available for the heavily favored Thunder to cover the spread, offering better value than the standard -110 at other bookmakers.

2. **Pacers +4.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM, -110)** - 4 units
   Reasoning: The Pacers are only moderate underdogs, and this spread offers good value in what's expected to be a closer game than the Thunder-Timberwolves matchup.

3. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 215.5 (FanDuel, -108)** - 3 units
   Reasoning: Best odds for the under in a game with a relatively low total, suggesting both teams' defensive capabilities are respected by the market.

4. **Pacers Moneyline (FanDuel, +158)** - 2 units
   Reasoning: Best odds for an underdog with a reasonable chance of winning, offering good value for the risk.

5. **Knicks-Pacers Total Under 223.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM, -110)** - 3 units
   Reasoning: With FanDuel setting the line at 223, there might be value in taking the higher number at the same odds.

Now I'll package these into the final recommendations.

Actually, I need to be careful about the middle opportunity recommendation. While it's a valid strategy, recommending two opposite sides of a bet might be confusing in this context. Instead, I'll focus on the individual bets that offer the best value.

So my final recommendations will be:

1. **Thunder -7.5 (BetMGM, -105)** - 3 units
2. **Pacers +4.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM, -110)** - 4 units
3. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 215.5 (FanDuel, -108)** - 3 units
4. **Pacers Moneyline (FanDuel, +158)** - 2 units
5. **Knicks-Pacers Total Under 223.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM, -110)** - 3 units

Let me make sure these are correctly formatted for the final response.
