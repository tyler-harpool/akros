I need to analyze the betting opportunities for the NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers scheduled for June 17, 2025. Let me organize the information provided and determine what insights I can draw:

## Game Information
- **Game**: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers
- **Date/Time**: June 17, 2025, 12:35:00 AM

## Betting Lines

### Moneyline Odds
- DraftKings: Thunder -395, Pacers +310
- FanDuel: Thunder -400, Pacers +315
- BetMGM: Thunder -450, Pacers +333

### Spread Odds
- DraftKings: Thunder -9.5 (-108), Pacers +9.5 (-112)
- FanDuel: Thunder -9.5 (-110), Pacers +9.5 (-110)
- BetMGM: Thunder -9.5 (-110), Pacers +9.5 (-110)

- FanDuel: 223.5 (-110 for both Over and Under)
- BetMGM: 223.5 (Over -115, Under -105)

## Missing Information
- No lineup data available for either team
- No injury information provided
- No statistical edge analysis provided (the report mentions "No significant edges detected")
- No information about the context of this game (regular season, playoffs, etc.)

## Analysis Based on Available Information

1. **Betting Market Consensus**:
   - Thunder are heavy favorites (ranging from -395 to -450 on the moneyline)
   - Spread is consistently set at Thunder -9.5 across all bookmakers
   - Total points consensus is 223.5 across all bookmakers

2. **Odds Comparison**:
   - For moneyline: BetMGM offers the best value for the Pacers (+333) if betting the underdog
   - For moneyline: DraftKings offers the best value for the Thunder (-395) if betting the favorite
   - For spread: DraftKings offers slightly better value on the Thunder at -9.5 (-108)
   - For totals: BetMGM offers better value on the Under at -105

3. **Market Inefficiencies**:
   - There's a notable difference in the moneyline odds between bookmakers, with BetMGM offering significantly higher odds on the Pacers (+333) compared to DraftKings (+310)
   - The spread is consistent across bookmakers, suggesting strong market consensus
   - BetMGM's totals odds are slightly skewed toward the Over (-115) compared to the Under (-105), while the other bookmakers have balanced odds

Without team lineup information, injury updates, or statistical analysis, my recommendations will need to be based primarily on the betting market differences and general basketball knowledge.

## Potential Betting Opportunities

1. **Value on Pacers Moneyline at BetMGM (+333)**:
   - This represents an implied probability of about 23.1%
   - If you believe the Pacers have better than a 23.1% chance to win outright, this could represent value
   - The significant difference between bookmakers suggests possible value

2. **Thunder Spread at DraftKings (-9.5 at -108)**:
   - Slightly better odds than other bookmakers for the same spread
   - If betting on the Thunder to cover, this offers the best value

3. **Under 223.5 at BetMGM (-105)**:
   - Better odds than the other bookmakers for the same total
   - BetMGM's odds suggest they might slightly favor the Over happening, creating potential value on the Under

4. **Thunder Moneyline at DraftKings (-395)**:
   - If betting on the heavy favorite, this offers slightly better odds than FanDuel
   - However, the heavy juice makes this a low-value bet in terms of return on investment

Without more context on team form, lineups, or injuries, these recommendations are primarily based on odds comparison rather than deep statistical analysis.

For my final recommendations, I'll consider the value proposition of each bet, factoring in the limited information available. I'll aim to provide a balanced set of recommendations with different risk profiles.

## Recommended Bets

1. **Indiana Pacers Moneyline (BetMGM, +333)** - 1 unit
   The significant disparity between bookmakers suggests potential value on the underdog at these odds.

2. **Oklahoma City Thunder -9.5 (DraftKings, -108)** - 2 units
   Best available odds for the Thunder to cover the spread.

3. **Under 223.5 Points (BetMGM, -105)** - 2 units
   The best odds available for the Under, with a slight skew in the betting market.

4. **Game Total Odd/Even - Even (hypothetical)** - Unfortunately, I don't have odds for this prop bet, so I can't include it.

Let me put these into the required format for the final response. Since I have only 3 concrete recommendations (due to limited information), I'll include those in the final table.
