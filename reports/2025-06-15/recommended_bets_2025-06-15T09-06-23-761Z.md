## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +333 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | BetMGM's odds imply only a 23.1% win probability for the Pacers, significantly higher than other books, creating potential value on the underdog. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Best available odds for the Thunder to cover the spread, with slight value compared to other bookmakers offering -110. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | BetMGM offers the best odds for the Under, suggesting slight market inefficiency with value compared to -110 elsewhere. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Hedge position with small stake as a 9.5-point spread is significant, and underdogs can often keep games closer than expected. |

These recommendations are based primarily on identifying market inefficiencies between bookmakers. Without detailed lineup and injury information, a conservative approach is warranted with appropriate stake sizing to manage risk.
