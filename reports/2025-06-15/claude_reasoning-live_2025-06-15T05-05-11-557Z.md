Let me analyze the given NBA betting situation for the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game.

First, I'll summarize what information I have:

1. Game Details: 
   - Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers
   - Date: June 17, 2025
   - Time: 12:35:00 AM

2. Betting Lines:
   - Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-395 to -450) across bookmakers
   - Spread: Thunder -9.5 across all bookmakers
   - Total Points: 223.5 across all bookmakers

3. Missing Information:
   - No lineup data available for either team
   - No injury information provided
   - No statistical edges have been detected in the markets
   - No in-game information about the current score, quarter, or time remaining
   - No information about recent performance or team trends

Given that this is supposed to be a LIVE in-game betting analysis, the lack of information about the current game state is a significant limitation. I don't know:
- The current score
- Time remaining
- Which quarter
- Recent momentum shifts
- Who's playing well or poorly
- Who's in foul trouble
- Recent shooting percentages in this game

For a proper live betting analysis, I would need this information. Without it, I'm essentially working with pre-game lines, but the instruction specifically asks for live in-game betting opportunities.

Given these constraints, I'll try to provide the best analysis possible based on what I know:

1. The Thunder are heavy favorites both on the moneyline and the spread (-9.5 points), suggesting they're expected to win comfortably.

2. The total points line of 223.5 indicates an expected moderately high-scoring game.

3. There doesn't appear to be much disagreement between bookmakers on the odds, with only minor variations.

4. BetMGM has the most favorable odds for betting the under at -105 compared to -110 at other books.

5. For moneyline underdog bets, BetMGM offers the best value on the Pacers at +333.

Without knowing the current game state, it's difficult to make specific live betting recommendations. However, I can suggest some general scenarios where certain bets might have value:

1. If the Thunder are trailing or the game is close, their moneyline odds might lengthen, potentially creating value given their pre-game favorite status.

2. If the game is lower scoring than expected in the early stages, the under could have value as teams may be playing stronger defense than anticipated.

3. If the Pacers are keeping it competitive and the spread has moved beyond -9.5 in live betting, taking the Pacers to cover might have value.

4. If one team is shooting unusually well or poorly from three-point range early on, there might be regression to the mean expected, affecting both spread and totals.

For my recommendations, I'll have to make some assumptions about potential live betting scenarios, since I don't have actual in-game information.
