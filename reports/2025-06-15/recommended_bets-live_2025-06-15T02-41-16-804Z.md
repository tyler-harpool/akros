## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | The consistency of the spread across books suggests line stability. If Pacers are showing any offensive rhythm, there's value on the underdog at this number. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -395 (DraftKings) | 1 unit | DraftKings offers the best value if backing the favorite, with significantly better odds than BetMGM's -450. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 units | BetMGM offers the best odds on the under. Late-game scenarios often favor unders as pace slows with intentional fouls and clock management. |

**Note:** These recommendations would be significantly more refined with information about the current score, time remaining, and recent performance trends. For optimal live betting, closely monitor the actual game dynamics before placing these bets.
