## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -395 | 2 | If Thunder trail by 5+ points early, their ML odds should lengthen substantially beyond -395, creating value based on their expected overall superiority |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 223.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers best value for the under; if early defensive intensity exceeds expectations, live totals often overadjust |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Alternative Spread | Pacers +12.5 | -110* | 2 | If Pacers fall behind by 15+ points early, buying additional points on a live spread could provide value as games typically tighten in the 4th quarter |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Player Props | First basket scorer - SGA | +450* | 1 | If available as a live bet before tipoff, Gilgeous-Alexander's offensive aggressiveness makes this a value play |

*Estimated odds for live scenarios based on typical market adjustments

Note: For truly optimal live betting recommendations, we would need current score, time remaining, recent performance trends, and foul situations. The above represents potential value scenarios to monitor as the game unfolds.
