Now, let's analyze each betting market:

### Moneyline Analysis
The bookmakers consistently price the Thunder as significant favorites, with implied probabilities around:
- DraftKings: ~79.2% for Thunder win
- FanDuel: ~80% for Thunder win
- BetMGM: ~81.8% for Thunder win

The Pacers' odds range from +300 to +333, suggesting an implied probability of winning between 23.1% and 25%. The slight variation suggests BetMGM provides the best value for a Pacers upset at +333.

### Spread Analysis
All bookmakers have set the spread at Thunder -9.5, meaning the Thunder are expected to win by at least 10 points. The odds are very close across all platforms, with DraftKings offering slightly better value for the Thunder at -108 compared to -110 elsewhere.

A 9.5-point spread is significant and suggests a clear talent disparity between the teams.

### Totals Analysis
The consensus total of 223.5 points with mostly -110 odds for both over and under suggests a balanced market. BetMGM offers slightly better value for the under at -105 compared to -110 elsewhere.

## Factors to Consider

### Home Court Advantage
The Thunder have home court advantage, which typically provides a 2-4 point edge. This has likely been factored into the spread.

### Team Strengths
Without lineup information, we need to rely on the betting market's assessment. The 9.5-point spread and heavy moneyline odds favor the Thunder, suggesting they are significantly stronger than the Pacers.

### Pace and Style
Without specific team data, we can't analyze pace and style matchups. However, the total of 223.5 suggests a moderately high-scoring game, which is typical for the modern NBA.

### Value Assessment

The lack of team lineups and injury information makes detailed analysis challenging. However, we can look for small inefficiencies in the odds between bookmakers:

1. For a Pacers upset, BetMGM offers the best value at +333
2. For the Thunder to cover the spread, DraftKings offers the best value at -108
3. For the under, BetMGM offers the best value at -105

Given the information available, here's my assessment:

1. The 9.5-point spread is significant but not extreme for the NBA. Without knowing team dynamics, I'm cautious about recommending the spread.
2. The moneyline for the Thunder offers minimal value given the high juice.
3. The Pacers moneyline at +333 (BetMGM) could be worth a small-stakes flyer if you believe the market is overvaluing the Thunder.
4. The total line seems fairly priced, but BetMGM's -105 for the under offers slightly better value than other options.

Based on this limited information, I'll make recommendations that focus on the best value bets among the available options, keeping stakes moderate due to the information gaps.

Let me prepare my recommendations:
