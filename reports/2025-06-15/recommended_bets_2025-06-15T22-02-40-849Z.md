## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -110 | 3 units | High spreads often provide value, especially when markets potentially overvalue favorites. FanDuel and BetMGM offer identical lines at -110. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -380 | 2 units | If you believe Thunder will win, DraftKings offers the best value at -380 compared to -405 (FanDuel) and -450 (BetMGM). |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -108 | 2 units | FanDuel offers the best price for the under, providing slight value over the standard -110. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Market | Pacers Moneyline | +333 | 1 unit | For risk-tolerant bettors, BetMGM offers the best underdog value. At +333, you only need >23% win probability to find value. |

These recommendations balance risk and reward while capitalizing on the market inefficiencies present in the current odds structure. Without detailed team information, focusing on price disparities offers the clearest path to potential value.
