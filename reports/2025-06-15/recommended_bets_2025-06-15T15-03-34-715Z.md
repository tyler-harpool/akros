## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 2 | Line appears slightly inflated; large spreads often favor underdogs statistically. DraftKings offers reasonable juice at -112. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +333 | 1 | BetMGM offers the best underdog value. Small stake justified as a value play when comparing implied probability to actual win chances. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best value on the under. Home favorites often play more controlled basketball, particularly in important games. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alternate Spread | Thunder -5.5 | +130 | 2 | A recommended alternate spread (available at most books) that provides better value than the standard moneyline while requiring a less dominant win than -9.5. |

These recommendations focus on finding value in a market that appears efficiently priced. The higher stakes on the under reflects the slightly better odds value compared to other options. Without detailed lineup information, a measured approach with moderate stakes is advisable.
