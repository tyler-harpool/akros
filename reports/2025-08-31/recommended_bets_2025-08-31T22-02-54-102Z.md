## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Philadelphia 76ers @ Boston Celtics (10/22/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | +110 | 3 units | These Eastern Conference rivals typically play close games, and getting the talented 76ers at plus money represents solid value in what should be a competitive matchup. |
| San Antonio Spurs @ Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +10 | -105 | 4 units | This Christmas Day game features a large spread that overvalues the Thunder. Holiday games tend to be more competitive than regular season matchups, and nationally televised games often see underdogs perform better than expected. |
| Houston Rockets @ Los Angeles Lakers (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Rockets | -102 | 3 units | This post-Christmas matchup has the Rockets priced near even money despite their continued improvement as a franchise. With minimal home court edge factored in, this represents good value for a competitive Western Conference team. |
| Chicago Bulls @ Detroit Pistons (10/23/2025) | Spread | Bulls +2 | -110 | 2 units | Home underdogs often present value in the NBA, especially when the talent gap between teams is minimal. Chicago's home court advantage is being undervalued in this matchup. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves @ Denver Nuggets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -108 | 3 units | The Timberwolves have been steadily improving, and five points provides a comfortable cushion in what should be a competitive Western Conference matchup. These teams typically play close games against each other. |

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward while targeting situations where the betting market appears to have overreacted to team reputations rather than actual performance expectations.
