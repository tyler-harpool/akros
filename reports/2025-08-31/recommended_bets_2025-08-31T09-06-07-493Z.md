## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors (11/15/2025) | Moneyline | Spurs | -110 | 4 units | Home court advantage typically worth 2-3 points in NBA, but this line is essentially a pick'em. Significant value on the Spurs at home when the market views this as a 50/50 game. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24/2025) | Total | Under 234.5 | -110 | 3 units | Exceptionally high total requiring sustained offensive efficiency from both teams. Denver and Golden State both possess strong defensive capabilities that should keep this game under this inflated number. |
| Houston Rockets vs Los Angeles Lakers (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Rockets | +104 | 3 units | Value on the improving Rockets against an aging Lakers squad playing on the second night of back-to-back holiday games. Lakers' veteran stars likely to show fatigue in this scheduling spot. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves vs Denver Nuggets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +4.5 | -112 | 3 units | FanDuel's spread is half-point better than DraftKings' 5-point line. Minnesota has demonstrated ability to play Denver closely, making this larger spread attractive in what should be a competitive divisional matchup. |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings (10/23/2025) | Moneyline | Suns | -118 | 2 units | In a projected close matchup (1-point spread), the slight favorite Suns offer solid value at home where they typically perform stronger. The minimal juice on this moneyline presents better value than the -1 spread. |

These selections represent the most compelling value opportunities across the extensive list of games, focusing on situations where odds appear mispriced based on home court advantage, situational factors, or differences between bookmakers.
