Let me analyze the available betting lines for the Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game.

First, I'll note what information I have and what I'm missing:

Information I have:
- The game is scheduled for June 20, 2025, at 12:35 AM
- Betting lines (moneyline, spread, and totals) from three bookmakers: DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM

Information I'm missing:
- Current game state (score, quarter, time remaining)
- Player lineups
- Key injuries
- Recent performance data
- Statistical edges (the analysis says no significant edges were detected)

Since this is a live in-game betting analysis, I'm missing crucial information about the current state of the game. However, I'll work with what I have and make some observations based on the betting lines.

Let's analyze the available betting markets:

1. Moneyline Odds:
   - Oklahoma City Thunder is favored across all bookmakers (negative odds)
   - DraftKings: Thunder -258, Pacers +210
   - FanDuel: Thunder -255, Pacers +210
   - BetMGM: Thunder -275, Pacers +220

2. Spread Odds:
   - Thunder are favored by 6.5 points across all bookmakers
   - Vig (juice) varies slightly between bookmakers

3. Totals (Over/Under):
   - Consistent total of 222.5 points across all bookmakers
   - Slight variations in the odds for over/under

Observations:
1. The betting market appears to be relatively efficient, with minimal differences between bookmakers.
2. BetMGM has slightly more favorable odds for the Pacers moneyline (+220 compared to +210 at other books).
3. FanDuel has slightly better odds for the Over (-106 compared to -110 and -105).

Without knowing the current game state, it's challenging to make specific live betting recommendations. However, I can identify some potential value plays based on the odds discrepancies:

1. If betting on the Pacers moneyline, BetMGM offers the best value at +220.
2. If betting on the Thunder spread, DraftKings offers the best value at -6.5 (-108).
3. If betting the Over, FanDuel offers the best value at 222.5 (-106).
4. If betting the Under, DraftKings offers the best value at 222.5 (-110) compared to FanDuel's -114 and BetMGM's -115.

Given the lack of specific game information, I'll need to make some assumptions for my recommendations. Since this is an in-game analysis, I'll assume we're early in the game without a significant lead by either team yet. I'll focus on identifying the best values among the available odds.

For my recommendations, I'll prioritize:
1. The best odds available for each market
2. Reasonable stakes based on value (without knowing specific edges)
3. Clear reasoning based on the odds comparison

I'll now create my recommended bets section:
