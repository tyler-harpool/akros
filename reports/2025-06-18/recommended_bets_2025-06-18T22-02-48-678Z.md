## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -112 | 3 | Home teams typically perform better against the spread, and 6.5 points provides valuable cushion in what could be a competitive game |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Totals | Under 221.5 | -110 | 2 | Without knowing lineup information, the under presents value as games often run at a slower pace than bookmakers anticipate |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 | 1 | Home underdog at +210 offers potential value considering the typical 2-3 point home court advantage in the NBA |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alternative Spread | Thunder -3.5 | +140* | 2 | If you believe OKC will win but by a smaller margin than the spread suggests, this hypothetical alternative line offers value |

*Note: Alternative spread odds are estimated as they aren't provided in the data

These recommendations balance the risk profile across different bet types, with higher stakes on selections with greater probability of success while still targeting value opportunities.
