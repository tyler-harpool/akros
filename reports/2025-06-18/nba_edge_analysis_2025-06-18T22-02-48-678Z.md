## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -112 | 3 | Home teams typically perform better against the spread, and 6.5 points provides valuable cushion in what could be a competitive game |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Totals | Under 221.5 | -110 | 2 | Without knowing lineup information, the under presents value as games often run at a slower pace than bookmakers anticipate |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 | 1 | Home underdog at +210 offers potential value considering the typical 2-3 point home court advantage in the NBA |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alternative Spread | Thunder -3.5 | +140* | 2 | If you believe OKC will win but by a smaller margin than the spread suggests, this hypothetical alternative line offers value |
