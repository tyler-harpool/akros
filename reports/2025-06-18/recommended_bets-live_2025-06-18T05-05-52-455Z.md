## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | The spread appears too high given the Pacers' offensive capability; strong value if they're shooting efficiently and keeping pace |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Total | Under 222.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 | Games often tighten defensively as they progress; this total has value if the defense is showing up at all |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +220 (BetMGM) | 2 | Excellent underdog value if the game is within single digits in the second half |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -258 (DraftKings) | 2 | Reasonable price to back the favorite if they're showing control of the game's tempo |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | 2H Total | Under (line dependent) | -- | 2 | Second halves often see defensive adjustments and slower pace; look for value on the under if the first half was high-scoring |

Note: For most effective live betting, I would need current score, time remaining, and recent momentum indicators to provide more specific recommendations.
