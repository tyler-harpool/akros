## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +215 | 1 | Best underdog value across bookmakers; +215 at FanDuel represents implied 31.7% win probability, which may be undervalued |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -108 | 2 | Best price at DraftKings; home underdog spread offers value in what could be a competitive game |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 222.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers best price; slight market disagreement on over/under juice suggests value on over |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -108 | 2 | Best price at FanDuel; Thunder as favorite at value price offers alternative perspective |

While making these recommendations with limited team information, the focus remains on identifying the best available odds across bookmakers to maximize potential return regardless of outcome. The stakes are kept moderate due to the lack of detailed lineup and injury information.
