## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23) | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -102 | 4 units | This line suggests a virtual toss-up despite Dallas likely having the more established roster. With Luka Doncic leading the Mavs against a still-developing Spurs team, the minimal spread offers significant value. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22) | Moneyline | Celtics | -130 | 3 units | The defending champions (presumed) are only modest favorites at home against Philadelphia. Boston's home court advantage and championship pedigree aren't fully reflected in this price, creating a value opportunity. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 units | FanDuel's -190 offers significantly better value than DraftKings' -218. Denver's home-court advantage at altitude has historically been strong against Minnesota, and this price difference creates a clear value opportunity. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 | 2 units | The Warriors are barely favored at home against a Houston team that's likely still developing. Golden State's home court has traditionally been one of the strongest in the NBA, making this near pick'em price extremely attractive. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Detroit Pistons (10/27) | Moneyline | Cavaliers | -122 | 2 units | Cleveland as only slight road favorites against a rebuilding Detroit team offers good value. The Cavaliers should have the superior roster, and this modest price doesn't fully reflect the talent gap between these teams. |

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward, focusing on situations where the betting markets appear to have mispriced outcomes based on team strength, home-court advantage, and historical performance patterns.
