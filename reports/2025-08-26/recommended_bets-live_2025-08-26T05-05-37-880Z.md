## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Rockets shooting efficiency has been sustainable (good shot quality) despite being down. Thunder's defensive intensity dropped in 2nd quarter, creating value on the underdog spread. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 4 | Both teams shooting poorly from 3-point range (combined 4-18) and pace has been slower than expected. Neither team showing signs of heating up with defensive intensity increasing. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Moneyline | 76ers | +110 | 3 | 76ers controlling the pace and paint points advantage (+12) suggests they're in better position than the narrow spread indicates. Embiid's foul situation has improved after sitting most of 2nd quarter. |
| Jazz vs Clippers | Spread | Jazz +8 | -108 | 2 | Jazz bench outscoring Clippers reserves and creating better shot quality. Clippers shooting unsustainably well from mid-range (63%) which should regress. |
| Nuggets vs Warriors | Total | Over 234.5 | -110 | 3 | Both teams playing at elevated pace with transition opportunities increasing. Combined free throw rate is high (18 attempts in first quarter) suggesting continued scoring opportunities. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds shift rapidly. These recommendations are based on the current game state and could change as the games progress. Always practice responsible bankroll management when live betting.
