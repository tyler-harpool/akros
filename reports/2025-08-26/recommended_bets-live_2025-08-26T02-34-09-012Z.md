## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Celtics vs 76ers | Spread | 76ers +2 | -110 | 3 | Elite teams matchup where 2 points offers significant value in what's likely a back-and-forth contest with multiple lead changes |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Moneyline | Warriors | +136 | 2 | Warriors' shooting variance makes them dangerous live underdogs, especially if Lakers build an early lead that's likely to fluctuate |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Young Rockets team typically plays close first halves before experience gap shows later; spread offers value in competitive portion |
| Hawks vs Raptors | Total | Under 236.5 | -110 | 2 | Extremely high total that's likely to see defensive adjustments after initial scoring runs; live under offers value |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -102 | 3 | Near pick'em pricing despite Dallas's experience edge; offers value if Spurs have early shooting variance creating a small lead |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as odds shift rapidly with game events. Focus on games where the score doesn't match the pre-game expectations, as these often create the most significant live betting value.
