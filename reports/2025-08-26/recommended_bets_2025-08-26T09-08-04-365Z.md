## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant pricing discrepancy between books. Denver's altitude advantage is maximized in post-Christmas game against potentially fatigued opponent. |
| Boston Celtics at Detroit Pistons (11/26/25) | Moneyline | Boston Celtics | -102 | 3 | Elite team at nearly even money against historically weaker opponent. Boston's talent advantage should overcome Detroit's home court. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24/25) | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 | 3 | Warriors traditionally start seasons strong at Chase Center. The -1 spread offers better value than moneyline with push protection. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Houston Rockets (11/8/25) | Spread | Spurs +3 | -110 | 2 | Home underdogs in divisional matchups offer historical value. Spurs should compete strongly at home against division rival. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder (1/19/26) | Spread | Cavaliers +1 | -105 | 2 | MLK Day home team with positive spread. Holiday games tend to energize home crowds and Cleveland matches up well against OKC's personnel. |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management and consider how these selections fit within your overall betting strategy.
