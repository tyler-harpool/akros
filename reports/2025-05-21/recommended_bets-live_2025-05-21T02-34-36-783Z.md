## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -10.5 | -115 (DraftKings) | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: The heavy odds suggest Thunder have established control. If maintaining a 12+ point lead in 3rd/4th quarter, they should close strongly with superior depth and home court advantage. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 196.5 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: With Thunder in control, expect a slower 4th quarter pace. Minnesota may struggle to score against OKC's defense when playing from behind, and Thunder likely to manage clock rather than push pace. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | New York has strong home court advantage at MSG and FanDuel offers the best price. Knicks' defensive identity should help them control the game against Indiana's inconsistent road performance. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 224 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | Both teams have been playing at a faster pace recently, and Indiana's defensive lapses should allow the Knicks to score efficiently, while the Pacers' offense remains potent enough to contribute to a high-scoring affair. |

Note: For live bets, current game situation (score, momentum, foul trouble) should be verified before placing wagers, as these recommendations are based on implied game state from the odds.
