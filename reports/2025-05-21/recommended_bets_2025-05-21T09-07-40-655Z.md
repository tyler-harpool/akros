## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | -115 | 3 units | BetMGM offers the highest total line; playoff basketball tends toward lower scoring with increased defensive intensity |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -105 | 3 units | BetMGM offers the best price on a large spread that could be difficult for the Thunder to cover in a potential playoff setting |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers -4.5 | -106 | 2 units | FanDuel offers the best price for the favored home team to cover a reasonable spread |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Total | Under 213.5 | -105 | 2 units | BetMGM offers the lowest total with favorable odds; playoff matchups between defensive teams tend to go under |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Knicks | +160 | 1 unit | FanDuel offers the best underdog value if the Knicks can keep it close and potentially pull off an upset |

These recommendations prioritize finding the best available prices across bookmakers while accounting for typical playoff basketball tendencies. Without detailed team information, I've weighted my stakes according to the relative value and historical reliability of each bet type.
