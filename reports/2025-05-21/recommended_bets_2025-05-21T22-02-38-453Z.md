## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers @ Knicks | Moneyline | Pacers | +166 | 2 units | FanDuel offers the best price on this road underdog play. The 4.5-point spread suggests a competitive game where Indiana has legitimate upset potential. |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Total | Over 222.5 | -105 | 3 units | BetMGM offers the best odds for the over, only 0.5 points higher than other books. Both teams likely to push pace in a game with offensive firepower. |
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -105 | 3 units | DraftKings offers the best value for Minnesota. Large NBA spreads often provide value, especially in playoff/important late-season contexts where games tighten. |
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Total | Under 214.5 | -108 | 2 units | FanDuel has the best price for this under. Both teams historically strong defensively, and high-stakes games often feature more deliberate pace and tighter defense. |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -110 | 2 units | Road underdogs getting 4-5 points offer statistical value in competitive matchups. This provides a cushion while still offering a solid return. |

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward by identifying the best available prices across different sportsbooks while considering the implied probabilities of each outcome compared to my assessment of the true probabilities.
