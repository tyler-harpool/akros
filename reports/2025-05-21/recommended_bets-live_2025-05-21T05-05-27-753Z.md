## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks +4.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 4 | The Knicks are showing they can match Indiana's tempo. The game remains competitive and the Knicks typically perform well in close games with their defensive intensity. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 213.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Both teams are settling into half-court offensive sets with elite rim protectors (Gobert/Holmgren) limiting easy baskets. The defensive intensity suggests a lower-scoring game than the line indicates. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Knicks | +160 (FanDuel) | 2 | The Knicks are demonstrating they can hang with the Pacers, making this underdog price attractive given the competitive nature of the game we're seeing. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Timberwolves | +260 (BetMGM) | 1 | Edwards is finding his rhythm and creating scoring opportunities. This is a high-value opportunity if Minnesota can keep the game within single digits into the fourth quarter. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 224 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | Both teams are pushing pace and finding offensive success. Current shooting percentages and tempo indicate this game should exceed the total. |

Remember that timing is crucial with live betting - these recommendations are based on the current game states and odds. Monitor how momentum shifts and adjust accordingly.
