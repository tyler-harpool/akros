## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers @ Knicks | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best value for the underdog spread; FanDuel offers slightly better juice than competitors; 4.5 points provides solid cushion in what could be a competitive game |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | BetMGM offers the best value on this under; playoff/tournament games often feature tighter defense and lower scoring |
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -105 (DraftKings) | 3 | DraftKings offers the best value on this large spread; 7.5 points is significant coverage against a potentially closer game than odds suggest |
| Timberwolves @ Thunder | Total | Under 214 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Slightly better value than other books; defensive intensity often increases in high-stakes games, leading to lower scoring totals |

These recommendations prioritize line shopping for the best available odds while focusing on underdog spreads and unders, which historically offer better value in playoff/tournament contexts without specific injury or lineup advantages.
