Let me analyze the current betting situation for the NBA games provided, focusing specifically on the live in-game betting opportunities for the Thunder vs Timberwolves game.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (LIVE)

First, I'll analyze what the odds are telling us about the current game state:

**Moneyline:**
- Thunder are heavily favored at -1150 to -1450
- Timberwolves are significant underdogs at +650 to +700

**Spread:**
- Thunder -10.5 across all bookmakers
- The juice varies slightly (-115 to -130) but the line is consistent

**Totals:**
- FanDuel: 195.5 (Under favored at -128)
- DraftKings/BetMGM: 196.5 (DraftKings even juice, BetMGM favors Over at -125)

These odds strongly suggest that the Thunder have a substantial lead in this game. The -10.5 point spread and heavily favored moneyline indicate the Thunder are likely ahead by at least 10-12 points or more, and the bookmakers see very little chance of the Timberwolves mounting a comeback.

The total of around 196 points suggests we're probably in the second half of the game, possibly late 3rd quarter or 4th quarter, with a moderately low-scoring affair. The slight edge toward the under on FanDuel may indicate the pace has slowed or that the game has been lower scoring than anticipated.

Without specific information on the current score, time remaining, or player performance in the live game, I need to be cautious with recommendations. However, I can look for potential value based on the patterns in the odds.

For the Knicks vs Pacers game, this appears to be a pre-game analysis as it hasn't started yet (scheduled for 5/22/2025). I'll include this in my overall analysis but focus more on the live Thunder-Timberwolves game.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (Pre-Game)

**Moneyline:**
- Knicks favored at home (-180 to -190)
- Pacers moderate underdogs (+150 to +156)

**Spread:**
- Knicks -4.5 across all bookmakers
- Juice is fairly standard (-110), with slight variation on FanDuel

**Totals:**
- 224 to 224.5 points
- Standard -110 juice across the board

This looks like a competitive matchup with the Knicks having moderate home court advantage. The total suggests an expected high-scoring game.

Now, let's formulate some potential betting recommendations based on this analysis:

## For Thunder vs Timberwolves (LIVE):

1. **Total Under Consideration**: 
   The total line is set at 195.5-196.5. Without knowing the current score and time remaining, it's difficult to make a strong recommendation. However, if we're in the late stages of the game with a comfortable Thunder lead, we might expect a slower pace as they protect their lead.

2. **Thunder Spread**:
   At -10.5, this suggests the Thunder have a substantial lead. If Minnesota is making a small run to close the gap, there could be value in the Thunder spread if the lead is currently 12+ points and there's concern about a Timberwolves comeback that isn't likely to materialize.

3. **Race to Points**:
   Though not directly listed, live race-to-points markets can offer value when a team is in control and likely to reach point thresholds first.

## For Knicks vs Pacers (Pre-Game):

1. **Knicks Spread**:
   At -4.5, this is a reasonable home favorite line. The Knicks have historically been strong at Madison Square Garden.

2. **Game Total**:
   The 224/224.5 line suggests a high-scoring affair expected between these teams.

Without more context on the current state of the Thunder-Timberwolves game (score, time remaining, player performance, foul trouble, etc.), it's challenging to provide highly specific live betting recommendations. The odds suggest the Thunder are in control, but we would need to know more about the game dynamics to make confident live betting suggestions.

For any live betting recommendation, I would need to consider:
- Current score and time remaining
- Momentum shifts
- Player foul trouble
- Recent shooting performance
- Injuries or fatigue factors

Given the limited information, I'll provide more general recommendations based on the patterns observed in the odds, while being appropriately cautious about live betting suggestions.

Let me start building my recommendations:

### RECOMMENDED BETS:

For the Thunder vs Timberwolves game:
1. If the Thunder are up by 12+ points in the 3rd/4th quarter, the -10.5 spread could have value, especially if Minnesota is showing fatigue or has key players in foul trouble.
2. If the game has been lower scoring than expected and is in the late stages, the Under 196.5 on DraftKings or BetMGM could be valuable.

For the Knicks vs Pacers pre-game:
1. The Knicks -4.5 spread looks reasonable if they're at full strength against the Pacers.
2. Given the high total of 224, and assuming both teams have their key offensive players available, the Over could be worth considering.

I'll need to format these into proper recommendations with the appropriate columns and real odds from the data.

Since I'm making both live game recommendations and pre-game recommendations, I'll clearly indicate which are IN-GAME recommendations in the Reasoning column.

Let me structure this appropriately:

1. Thunder -10.5 (-115) from DraftKings - This represents the best value among the spread odds
2. Under 196.5 (-115) from DraftKings - This offers better value than FanDuel's 195.5
3. Knicks -4.5 (-106) from FanDuel - This is the best price available for the Knicks spread
4. Over 224.5 (-110) from BetMGM - Slight variation in the total line offers a bit more value

With the limited information on the live game, I need to be cautious and make it clear these are conditional recommendations based on the most likely game state suggested by the odds.

However, I realize I still don't have specific information about the current score, time remaining, and momentum in the Thunder-Timberwolves game, which makes specific live betting recommendations difficult. I should acknowledge this limitation in my response and make it clear that any live betting recommendations are based on assumptions about the game state that would need to be verified.

Let me construct my final recommendations with appropriate caveats:
