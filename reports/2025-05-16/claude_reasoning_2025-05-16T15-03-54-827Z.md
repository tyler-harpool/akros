I'll analyze the NBA betting opportunities for the two games provided: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets.

First, let's establish what information we have and what's missing:

What we have:
- Betting lines (moneyline, spread, totals) from multiple bookmakers
- Game dates and times

What we're missing:
- Team lineups (stated as not available)
- Injury information (section is empty)
- Statistical edges (none detected according to the data)
- Historical matchup data
- Recent team performance data
- Home/away performance trends

Given these limitations, I'll need to analyze these games based on:
1. Line comparison across bookmakers to find potential value
2. Logical analysis of team strengths and matchups based on general NBA knowledge
3. Assessment of the playoff context (since these appear to be playoff games)

Let's start by analyzing each game:

## Game 1: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/17/2025)

### Betting Lines Analysis:
- Moneyline: Boston is favored across all bookmakers (-142 to -145)
- Spread: Boston favored by 2.5 points across all bookmakers
- Totals: Range from 210.5 to 211.5 points

Small discrepancies:
- FanDuel has the lowest total at 210.5 while others are at 211.5
- BetMGM offers slightly better value on the Over for totals (-105 vs -110)
- For Knicks spread bettors, FanDuel offers slightly better value (+2.5 at -106)

### Team Context:
While specific lineup information isn't available, we can consider:
- Boston Celtics are traditionally a strong playoff team
- The 2.5 point spread suggests a competitive matchup
- The relatively low total (210.5-211.5) suggests expectations of a defensive game

## Game 2: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)

### Betting Lines Analysis:
- Moneyline: OKC heavily favored (-278 to -325)
- Spread: OKC favored by 7-7.5 points
- Totals: Range from 212.5 to 213.5 points

Notable discrepancies:
- DraftKings offers a -7 spread for OKC while others are at -7.5
- DraftKings has the best moneyline value for OKC (-278 vs -310/-325)
- FanDuel has the highest total at 213.5 while others are at 212.5

### Team Context:
- The large spread suggests OKC is significantly favored
- Denver as the underdog is notable given their usual strength
- The game could be a playoff matchup where OKC has home court advantage

Now, let's evaluate potential betting opportunities based on the available information:

1. **Boston/New York Spread Value**:
   The 2.5 point spread is consistent across bookmakers, suggesting market consensus. Without more information on team form or injuries, it's difficult to identify clear value here.

2. **OKC/Denver Spread Opportunity**:
   DraftKings offers a -7 spread for OKC while others are at -7.5. This half-point difference could be valuable in a close game.

3. **Totals Discrepancy in Boston/New York**:
   FanDuel's 210.5 total vs. the 211.5 at other books presents a potential opportunity, particularly if you expect a defensive, lower-scoring game.

4. **OKC Moneyline Value**:
   If you believe OKC will win, the -278 at DraftKings offers better value than -310 (FanDuel) or -325 (BetMGM).

5. **Totals in OKC/Denver**:
   FanDuel's 213.5 vs. 212.5 elsewhere presents another half-point opportunity.

Based on this limited information, I'll make 3-5 betting recommendations focusing on the discrepancies in the odds that provide potential value. Without more team-specific data, I'll need to keep stakes moderate and base recommendations on the line values themselves rather than team-specific analysis.

Let me formulate the recommended bets:

1. **Bet on DraftKings OKC -7** - This half-point advantage over the -7.5 line elsewhere could be crucial in a close game.

2. **Bet on FanDuel Under 210.5 for Celtics/Knicks** - This is a point lower than other books, providing value if you expect a defensive contest.

3. **Bet on DraftKings OKC Moneyline -278** - Better value than other books if OKC is likely to win outright.

4. **Bet on BetMGM Over 211.5 at -105 for Celtics/Knicks** - Best odds for the over compared to other books.

5. **Bet on FanDuel Knicks +2.5 (-106)** - Best value if betting on the Knicks to cover.

Let me assign stakes based on the value of the discrepancies:

1. **OKC -7 (DraftKings)**: 3 units - Half-point advantage on the spread is significant
2. **Under 210.5 Celtics/Knicks (FanDuel)**: 2 units - Full point advantage on the total
3. **OKC Moneyline -278 (DraftKings)**: 2 units - Significant odds improvement over other books
4. **Over 211.5 Celtics/Knicks at -105 (BetMGM)**: 1 unit - Slight odds advantage
5. **Knicks +2.5 at -106 (FanDuel)**: 1 unit - Small odds advantage

Given the limited information, I'll keep my reasoning focused on the line value rather than making strong claims about team performance that I can't substantiate from the provided data.
