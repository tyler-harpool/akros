I'm analyzing live NBA betting opportunities for games currently in progress or upcoming. Let me break down the available information:

## Games Being Analyzed:

1. **Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder** - IN PROGRESS (started 5/16/2025, 12:44:46 AM)
2. **New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics** - UPCOMING (starts 5/17/2025, 12:00:00 AM)

Let me focus first on the live game (Nuggets vs Thunder) since that requires immediate attention due to its in-progress status.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (IN PROGRESS)

Looking at the betting lines:

**Moneyline:**
- DraftKings: Nuggets -280, Thunder +210
- BetMGM: Nuggets -250, Thunder +190
- FanDuel: Nuggets -340, Thunder +250

**Spread:**
- DraftKings: Nuggets -5.5 (-110), Thunder +5.5 (-120)
- BetMGM: Nuggets -5.5 (-105), Thunder +5.5 (-125)
- FanDuel: Nuggets -6.5 (+110), Thunder +6.5 (-146)

**Totals:**
- DraftKings: 226.5 (Over -120, Under -110)
- BetMGM: 227.5 (Over -110, Under -118)
- FanDuel: 227.5 (Over -108, Under -122)

Without specific information about the current game state (score, quarter, time remaining, etc.), I need to make inferences based on the odds. The Nuggets appear to be favorites, with a 5.5-6.5 point spread, suggesting they're likely leading or expected to pull ahead. The total points line of 226.5-227.5 is fairly standard for an NBA game.

**Confirmed Starting Lineups:**
- Thunder: Gilgeous-Alexander, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, Hartenstein
- Nuggets: Murray, Braun, Porter, Gordon, Jokic

These are both strong lineups with their star players (Jokic for Nuggets and SGA for Thunder).

Now for the upcoming game:

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (UPCOMING)

**Moneyline:**
- DraftKings: Knicks -142, Celtics +120
- FanDuel: Knicks -142, Celtics +120
- BetMGM: Knicks -140, Celtics +115

**Spread:**
- DraftKings: Knicks -2.5 (-105), Celtics +2.5 (-115)
- FanDuel: Knicks -2.5 (-110), Celtics +2.5 (-110)
- BetMGM: Knicks -2.5 (-105), Celtics +2.5 (-115)

**Totals:**
- DraftKings: 210 (Over -110, Under -110)
- FanDuel: 210 (Over -110, Under -110)
- BetMGM: 210.5 (Over -105, Under -115)

For this game, the Knicks are slight favorites at home against the Celtics, with a narrow 2.5-point spread. The total points line is set at 210-210.5, which is on the lower side for NBA games, suggesting expectations of a relatively slower-paced or defensive contest.

No lineup information is available for this game yet.

Given the information available, I'll focus more on the live game (Nuggets vs Thunder) since it's in progress and requires immediate attention. For the upcoming Knicks vs Celtics game, I'll provide some preliminary analysis based on the odds and market positions.

Since I don't have specific information about the current game state for the Nuggets vs Thunder game, I'll need to be careful with my recommendations. Let me analyze the betting opportunities based on what I can infer:

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (LIVE)

1. **Spread Analysis**: 
   - There's a discrepancy in the spread between FanDuel (-6.5) and the other books (-5.5).
   - FanDuel offers +110 for Nuggets -6.5, which is actually positive odds for a favorite, suggesting potential value.
   - If the Nuggets are pulling away, the -5.5 at BetMGM (-105) could be valuable.

2. **Totals Analysis**:
   - The totals are relatively consistent across books (226.5-227.5).
   - The Under is slightly favored in the odds, suggesting the game might be playing at a slower pace than expected.
   - BetMGM and FanDuel have the total at 227.5 with the Under at -118 and -122 respectively, indicating market movement toward the Under.

3. **Moneyline Analysis**:
   - BetMGM offers the best value for the Nuggets at -250 if you believe they will win.
   - FanDuel offers the best value for the Thunder at +250 if you believe they can come back.

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (UPCOMING)

1. **Spread Analysis**:
   - The spread is consistent across books at Knicks -2.5.
   - BetMGM and DraftKings offer slightly better value for Knicks at -105.

2. **Totals Analysis**:
   - BetMGM has a slightly higher total (210.5) compared to other books (210).
   - BetMGM offers the Over at -105, which is slightly better than the -110 at other books.

3. **Moneyline Analysis**:
   - BetMGM offers the best value for the Celtics at +115 (vs +120 elsewhere).
   - Moneyline odds are very consistent across books, suggesting market consensus.

For my recommendations, I'll need to be more selective with the live game since I don't have specific in-game information. I'll focus on identifying potential value based on the odds discrepancies and what I can infer about the game state.

### RECOMMENDED BETS:

For the live Nuggets vs Thunder game:

1. **Denver Nuggets -6.5 (+110) at FanDuel**
   - The positive odds for the favorite spread suggests value, especially if the Nuggets are currently leading or in control of the game.
   - 2 units

2. **Under 227.5 points (-118) at BetMGM**
   - The slight odds discrepancy and market movement suggest some value in the Under.
   - 1 unit

For the upcoming Knicks vs Celtics game:

3. **Boston Celtics +2.5 (-115) at DraftKings/BetMGM**
   - The Celtics have been a strong team and this spread offers value in what should be a competitive matchup.
   - 3 units

4. **Over 210.5 (-105) at BetMGM**
   - The slightly better odds for the over compared to other books offer some value.
   - 2 units

I'll format these recommendations in a proper markdown table as requested:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -6.5 | +110 | 2 | Value in positive odds for favorite spread in an IN-GAME situation, suggesting potential momentum for Denver |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 227.5 | -118 | 1 | Market movement toward the Under in this IN-GAME scenario suggests defensive effort increasing |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 | 3 | Celtics are a strong road team and this should be a competitive playoff matchup |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Over 210.5 | -105 | 2 | Slightly better odds than market consensus and both teams have offensive firepower |

However, without specific in-game information for the live Nuggets vs Thunder game, these recommendations come with higher uncertainty. If more detailed information about the current game state were available (score, time remaining, momentum shifts, foul trouble, etc.), I could provide more confident recommendations.

The recommendations for the Knicks vs Celtics game are based on the odds and general team analysis, but could be refined with more information about lineup status, injuries, and recent performance trends.

Actually, I should reconsider my recommendations given the limited information I have about the Nuggets vs Thunder game. Without knowing the current score, time remaining, and game flow, my in-game betting recommendations might not be appropriate. Let me revise my approach:

For the live Nuggets vs Thunder game, I'll focus on identifying potential value based strictly on the odds discrepancies, while acknowledging the increased uncertainty.

For the upcoming Knicks vs Celtics game, I'll maintain my recommendations but focus on the odds discrepancies and market inefficiencies.

### REVISED RECOMMENDED BETS:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -6.5 | +110 | 1 | Positive odds for favorite spread IN-GAME may indicate value if Nuggets have momentum, but limited stake due to uncertainty |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 | 3 | Celtics have strong road performance and this should be a competitive playoff matchup |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Over 210.5 | -105 | 2 | Slightly better odds than market consensus and expectation for offensive output |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | +250 | 1 | Best underdog value across books for IN-GAME opportunity if Thunder showing signs of competitiveness |

These recommendations acknowledge the limitations of my analysis for the live game while still identifying potential value based on the odds discrepancies. For the upcoming game, the recommendations are more confident based on the market positions and odds variations.

Actually, let me double-check if we have any information about injuries, as that could impact my analysis:

According to the provided data, there's no specific injury information mentioned. This is a limitation in my analysis, especially for the live game where injuries or foul trouble could significantly impact the game flow and outcome.

Given these limitations, I'll stick with my revised recommendations, acknowledging the increased uncertainty for the live game bets.

Actually, we should be focusing on the games that are IN PROGRESS for live betting opportunities.

Let's revise our analysis one more time to focus primarily on the Denver Nuggets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game that is currently in progress. Since this is a live game, we need to be more selective and focus on identifying potential value based on the odds discrepancies we can observe.

For the Nuggets vs. Thunder game:

1. **Spread Analysis**: 
   - FanDuel offers Nuggets -6.5 at +110, while other books have -5.5 at negative odds
   - This suggests FanDuel may be giving better value for the Nuggets if they have momentum

2. **Totals Analysis**:
   - DraftKings has a slightly lower total (226.5) than other books (227.5)
   - The Under is priced at -110 on DraftKings, compared to -118 at BetMGM and -122 at FanDuel
   - This suggests potential value in the Under at DraftKings if the game is trending toward lower scoring

3. **Moneyline Analysis**:
   - BetMGM offers the Nuggets at -250, which is better than DraftKings (-280) and much better than FanDuel (-340)
   - For the Thunder, FanDuel offers +250, which is better than DraftKings (+210) and BetMGM (+190)

Based on this analysis, I'll focus my recommendations on the identified value opportunities in the live game:

1. Nuggets -6.5 (+110) at FanDuel - The positive odds for a favorite spread is unusual and suggests value
2. Under 226.5 points (-110) at DraftKings - Best price for the Under across all books
3. Thunder Moneyline +250 at FanDuel - Best price for the underdog if you believe they have a chance to win

For the upcoming Knicks vs. Celtics game, I'll include one recommendation based on the best observed value:

4. Celtics +2.5 (-115) at DraftKings/BetMGM - The Celtics are a strong team and this spread offers value

Let me put these recommendations in the requested format:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -6.5 | +110 | 2 | Positive odds for favorite spread is unusual and offers value IN-GAME if Nuggets maintain control |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 | Best price for Under across all books for IN-GAME betting, suggesting potential value if defense tightens |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | +250 | 1 | Best underdog price across books for IN-GAME opportunity, worth small play if Thunder showing competitiveness |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 | 3 | Celtics are strong overall and this spread offers value in what should be a competitive matchup |

These recommendations focus primarily on the live game while acknowledging the increased uncertainty due to limited information about the current game state. The stake sizes reflect confidence levels given the available information, with smaller stakes for the live game bets due to the higher uncertainty.

Actually, I want to think about this a bit more deeply. I should try to infer the current game state from the betting lines, especially for the live game.

For the Nuggets vs Thunder game, the fact that the spread is between 5.5 and 6.5 points in favor of the Nuggets suggests one of two scenarios:
1. This was roughly the pre-game spread and the game is proceeding as expected (perhaps it's early in the game)
2. The Nuggets are leading by approximately this margin in the game

The moneyline odds (-250 to -340 for Nuggets) suggest a 71-77% implied probability of the Nuggets winning, which is fairly strong but not overwhelming. This could indicate that the Thunder are still within striking distance.

The total points line of 226.5-227.5 is fairly standard for an NBA game and doesn't give us much additional information about the current game state.

Given these inferences, let me refine my recommendations:

1. **If the Nuggets are leading but the Thunder are within striking distance**: The Thunder +6.5 at -146 (FanDuel) might offer value, especially if the Thunder have shown signs of being able to close the gap.

2. **If the game is proceeding as expected and is still in the early stages**: The Under 226.5 at -110 (DraftKings) might offer value, especially if both teams are showing good defensive effort.

3. **If the Nuggets are showing dominance**: The Nuggets -5.5 at -105 (BetMGM) might offer the best value among the spread options.

Without more specific in-game information, these recommendations come with increased uncertainty. Let me finalize my recommendations based on the most likely scenarios and the best observable value in the odds:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -6.5 | +110 | 2 | Positive odds for favorite spread suggests value IN-GAME if Nuggets have momentum and control |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 | Best price for Under across books, offering value IN-GAME if defensive intensity is increasing |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | +250 | 1 | Best underdog price across books, worth small play IN-GAME if Thunder showing signs of competitiveness |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 | 3 | Celtics strength suggests value in this relatively tight spread |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Over 210.5 | -105 | 2 | Slightly better odds than market consensus for teams with offensive capability |

These recommendations balance the identification of potential value in the odds while acknowledging the limitations of my analysis for the live game.

Okay, I think I have my final recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -6.5 | +110 | 2 | Positive odds for favorite spread offers value IN-GAME if Nuggets maintaining control |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 | Best price for Under across books for IN-GAME betting if defense is tightening |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | +250 | 1 | Best underdog price for IN-GAME opportunity if Thunder showing competitiveness |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 | 3 | Celtics strength provides value in this competitive playoff matchup |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Over 210.5 | -105 | 2 | Slightly better odds than consensus for teams with offensive firepower |
