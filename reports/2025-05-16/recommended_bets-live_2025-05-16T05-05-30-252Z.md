## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best available odds for the underdog in what appears to be a tight contest; FanDuel offers superior value compared to other books |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +128 (FanDuel) | 2 | Strong underdog value with the best available price; worth considering if the Knicks are showing competitive play or have momentum |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | FanDuel offers the best odds for the under; particularly valuable if defensive intensity has increased as the game progresses |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Largest available cushion for the underdog; valuable if OKC is performing better than the pre-game spread suggested |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Thunder | +260 (DraftKings) | 1 | Long-shot value play that becomes worth considering if Thunder have cut into Denver's expected advantage and momentum is shifting |

Remember that timing is crucial in live betting - these recommendations would have different values depending on the current score, time remaining, and momentum of each game.
