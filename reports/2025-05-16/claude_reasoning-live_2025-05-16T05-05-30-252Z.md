Let me analyze the current in-game betting opportunities for the NBA games provided. Since these are live in-game betting opportunities, I need to be selective and consider the current game state, momentum, and recent events to identify value.

There are two games to analyze:
1. New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
2. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

First, I'll note that there are some limitations in the data provided:
- No lineup information is available for any team
- No injury information is provided
- No information about the current game state (score, quarter, time remaining)
- No mention of specific playoff context (though these appear to be playoff games based on the dates and matchups)

Without the current game state information, it's difficult to make precise in-game betting recommendations. However, I can analyze the betting markets as they stand and look for potential value.

Let's examine each game:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

### Moneyline Odds
Boston is favored across all bookmakers, with odds ranging from -145 to -152. The Knicks are underdogs with odds ranging from +120 to +128.

### Spread Odds
Boston is favored by 2.5 points across all bookmakers.

### Totals
The total points line is set at 210 on DraftKings and FanDuel, and slightly higher at 210.5 on BetMGM.

Analysis:
- The tight odds across bookmakers suggest an efficient market with no obvious arbitrage opportunities.
- The 2.5-point spread indicates bookmakers expect a close game.
- The slight difference in the totals line between BetMGM (210.5) and the other books (210) might provide a small opportunity if the current game pace suggests a total landing exactly at 210.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

### Moneyline Odds
Denver is heavily favored with odds ranging from -310 to -325. OKC is a substantial underdog at +250 to +260.

### Spread Odds
Denver is favored by 7.5 points on DraftKings and BetMGM, and by 8 points on FanDuel.

### Totals
The total points line is set at 212 on FanDuel and DraftKings, and 212.5 on BetMGM.

Analysis:
- Denver is a substantial favorite, suggesting they either have a significant lead already or are expected to dominate.
- The half-point difference in the spread between FanDuel (8) and the other books (7.5) could be exploitable.
- Similarly, the half-point difference in the totals line might create value depending on the current game pace and scoring.

Without knowing the current game state, my recommendations would have to be more general. For in-game betting, the actual score, momentum, foul trouble, and time remaining are critical factors.

Let me craft some potential betting recommendations that would be relevant regardless of the exact current game state. These would be based on the odds presented and general basketball principles. I'll then format these according to the required structure.

Potential betting recommendations:

1. Knicks +2.5 (BetMGM, -110): In playoff basketball, close games often come down to the wire, and the Knicks have shown resilience all season. Taking the points here provides value if the game is currently close.

2. Under 212.5 points (BetMGM, -110) for Denver vs OKC: Playoff games often tighten up defensively, especially in the later stages. BetMGM offering a half-point higher total than other books provides value.

3. NY Knicks Moneyline (BetMGM, +120): If the game is close, the underdog moneyline provides good value, especially for a Knicks team that has performed well in tight games.

4. Denver -7.5 (DraftKings, -110): If Denver currently has momentum and a decent lead, they have the firepower to pull away and cover this spread.

Let me format these into the required table structure:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -110 | 3 | Close playoff matchup likely comes down to final possessions, providing value with the points |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212.5 | -110 | 2 | Taking advantage of the half-point higher line on BetMGM in what projects to be a defensive playoff battle |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +120 | 2 | Underdog value in what's expected to be a close game based on the tight spread |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets -7.5 | -110 | 2 | Denver has shown the ability to pull away from opponents in playoff settings with their offensive firepower |

That's my general approach, but I should note that without more specific in-game information, these recommendations are more speculative than they would be with complete live data. In real live betting scenarios, I would incorporate current score, time remaining, momentum, foul trouble, shooting percentages, and other relevant in-game factors to make more precise recommendations.

Wait, I need to revise this. The instructions stated that I am analyzing LIVE in-game betting opportunities, but the data provided doesn't include any live game information. Without knowing the current score, time remaining, or game context, I can't properly evaluate live betting opportunities.

Let me approach this differently. Since I am BetAnalyst providing live betting analysis, I should clarify that without current game state information, I can only provide general betting principles for these games rather than specific live betting recommendations.

Let me adjust my approach:

The data provided appears to be pre-game odds rather than live in-game odds, as there is no information about the current game state. For live betting analysis, I would need:
1. Current score
2. Time remaining
3. Recent momentum shifts
4. Player foul trouble
5. Current shooting percentages
6. Live odds that reflect the current game situation

Without this information, I can only provide general insights about potential betting value based on the pre-game odds.

For the Knicks vs Celtics game:
- The tight 2.5-point spread suggests a close game is expected
- The relatively low total of 210/210.5 points indicates bookmakers expect a defensive battle

For the Thunder vs Nuggets game:
- The 7.5/8-point spread favoring Denver suggests a more lopsided matchup
- The total of 212/212.5 is moderate for a Denver game, indicating some defensive expectations

Given these limitations, I'll provide betting recommendations based on general principles and the pre-game odds, while acknowledging that live betting decisions would require current game information.

Oh, wait. I think I'm overthinking this. The instructions are asking me to analyze live betting opportunities, but the data provided appears to be pre-game odds. I'm supposed to analyze these as if they were current live betting opportunities.

Let me reframe my thinking: I'll treat these odds as if they are the current live odds at some point during the games, even though specific game state information is missing. I'll frame my recommendations in the context of live betting principles and what would make these bets valuable during an ongoing game.

With that in mind, let me create my recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 3 | In live betting, taking points with a playoff underdog provides value when momentum could shift multiple times in a close matchup |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 3 | Live betting the under becomes valuable if the pace has been slower than expected or if defensive intensity has increased as the game progresses |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +124 (DraftKings) | 2 | The best underdog moneyline value available, worth a play if the Knicks are showing competitive play or have positive momentum |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Taking the largest available spread with the underdog provides a cushion if they're keeping the game competitive or showing signs of a potential comeback |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 210.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | Best under value across books, especially valuable if defensive intensity has increased or if shooting percentages have dropped as the game progresses |

In live betting, timing is everything, and without knowing the exact game state, these recommendations would be most valuable when:
1. For underdog spreads/moneylines: When the favorite is leading but not by the full spread, or when the underdog has momentum
2. For under bets: After a high-scoring quarter when regression to the mean is likely
3. For favorite spreads: When the favorite has momentum and is beginning to pull away

Actually, I just realized my recommendations don't perfectly match the requirements. Looking at the odds more carefully:

For Knicks vs Celtics:
- Best Knicks moneyline: +128 (FanDuel)
- Knicks spread: +2.5 (-106) at FanDuel is better than -110 at other books
- Total: Under 210.5 (-115) at BetMGM

For Thunder vs Nuggets:
- Best Thunder moneyline: +260 (DraftKings)
- Thunder spread: +8 (-112) at FanDuel or +7.5 (-110) at other books
- Total: Under 212.5 (-110) at BetMGM or Under 212 (-106) at FanDuel

Let me revise my recommendations with the exact odds from the provided data:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +128 (FanDuel) | 2 | Best underdog value for a close playoff matchup where momentum shifts can quickly change the outcome |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Most favorable odds for the spread, providing value in a game expected to be decided in the final possessions |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Thunder | +260 (DraftKings) | 1 | High-value longshot if Thunder are showing signs of competitiveness or momentum |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Largest available cushion for the underdog, valuable if the Thunder are keeping the game within single digits |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best odds for an under bet, particularly valuable if defensive intensity has increased or pace has slowed |

I've assigned stakes based on the perceived value and probability of each bet succeeding, with higher stakes for the more likely outcomes and lower stakes for longer shots.

Actually for this sample answer, I'm going to tone down and simplify my recommendations since we don't have actual live game information.

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best odds for the underdog spread in what's projected to be a close playoff battle |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +128 (FanDuel) | 2 | Strong value on the underdog in a tight matchup where momentum can quickly shift |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best odds for the under, valuable if defensive intensity has increased as the game progresses |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Largest available cushion for the underdog, particularly valuable if they're showing competitive play |
