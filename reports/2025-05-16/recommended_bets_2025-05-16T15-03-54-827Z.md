## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder -7 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other books' -7.5 line; critical in potential close finish |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 210.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Full point advantage compared to other books; playoff games often trend defensive |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Thunder | -278 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Significantly better value than FanDuel (-310) and BetMGM (-325) for the same outcome |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best odds available for Knicks spread across all bookmakers |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Over 213.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Line shopping advantage; potentially valuable if game pace exceeds expectations |

These recommendations focus on exploiting line discrepancies between bookmakers rather than team-specific advantages, given the limited contextual information available about lineups and injuries.
