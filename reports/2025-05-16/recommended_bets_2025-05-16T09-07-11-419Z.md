## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +126 | 2 | Best value across books for Knicks ML; tight 2.5 spread suggests realistic upset potential |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +7 | -110 | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books (7 vs 7.5); significant value in playoff context |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 210 | -108 | 3 | Playoff games tend toward defensive intensity; FanDuel offers best odds on this position |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 212 | -106 | 2 | Playoff unders historically profitable; best odds available at FanDuel |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel offers best value on Knicks spread; good hedge to pair with moneyline position |

These recommendations leverage the best available odds while focusing on typical playoff basketball dynamics. Without specific injury or lineup information, I've emphasized value spots where small edges exist between bookmakers.
