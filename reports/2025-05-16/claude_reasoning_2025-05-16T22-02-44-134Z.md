Let me analyze the provided NBA betting data for the two upcoming games: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets. I'll evaluate the betting odds, look for potential edges or inefficiencies, and then provide concrete betting recommendations.

First, let's organize what we know about each game:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/17/2025)

### Moneyline Odds:
- Boston (Home): -142 to -148 
- New York (Away): +118 to +126

### Spread:
- Boston -2.5 (odds range from -114 to -110)
- New York +2.5 (odds range from -110 to -106)

### Total Points:
- Over/Under: 211.5 (consistently across bookmakers)
- Odds: Generally -110 for both over and under

The bookmakers are fairly consistent in their pricing, with Boston being moderate favorites at home. The 2.5-point spread suggests a relatively competitive game. The consensus on the total points (211.5) indicates the bookmakers expect a moderately low-scoring game by NBA standards.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)

### Moneyline Odds:
- Oklahoma City (Home): -290 to -300
- Denver (Away): +235 to +240

### Spread:
- Oklahoma City -7 to -7.5 (odds range from -114 to -110)
- Denver +7 to +7.5 (odds range from -110 to -106)

### Total Points:
- Over/Under: 212.5 to 213 (slight variation between bookmakers)
- Odds: Range from -115 to -105 for the over/under

The Thunder are significant favorites at home, with the spread at 7-7.5 points. There's a slight discrepancy in the spread offered by DraftKings (-7) compared to other bookmakers (-7.5), which might present a small edge.

## Key Observations:

1. No lineup information is provided for any teams, which makes it difficult to assess how specific player matchups might affect game outcomes.

2. No injury information is provided, which is a crucial factor in NBA betting.

3. The data doesn't indicate what stage of the season these games are in (regular season or playoffs), though the date (May 2025) suggests these are playoff games.

4. There's no significant edge detected in the betting markets according to the provided analysis.

Let me now analyze potential betting opportunities for each game:

### Knicks vs Celtics Analysis:

This appears to be a close matchup with Boston having home-court advantage. The 2.5-point spread suggests bookmakers expect a competitive game that could go either way, with Boston having the slight edge. Without lineup information, we need to rely on the odds themselves for insights.

The consistency of the total points line at 211.5 across all bookmakers suggests strong consensus on the expected scoring. In close playoff games (assuming these are playoff games given the May date), teams often play tighter defense and scoring can be lower than regular season averages.

Looking at the best value available:
- Knicks moneyline: The best odds are +126 at FanDuel
- Celtics moneyline: The best odds are -142 at DraftKings
- Spread: FanDuel offers the best odds for taking the Knicks +2.5 at -106

### Thunder vs Nuggets Analysis:

Oklahoma City is heavily favored at home. The 7-7.5 point spread is significant but not overwhelming. There's an interesting discrepancy in the spread offered by DraftKings (-7) versus the other bookmakers (-7.5), which could present value.

For the total points, there's a slight variation with FanDuel offering 213 while others have 212.5. BetMGM offers -105 for the under 212.5, which is the best value for under bettors.

Looking at the best value available:
- Thunder moneyline: The best odds are -290 at DraftKings
- Nuggets moneyline: The best odds are +240 at both FanDuel and BetMGM
- Spread: DraftKings offers Nuggets +7 at -110, which is better than the +7.5 for similar odds
- Total: BetMGM offers Under 212.5 at -105, which is the best price for under bettors

Now, based on my analysis and the limited information provided, I'll formulate 3-5 concrete betting recommendations:

1. **Knicks +2.5 (-106) at FanDuel**: In close playoff matchups, taking the points often provides value. The Knicks getting 2.5 points at the best available odds seems like a reasonable play.

2. **Celtics-Knicks Under 211.5 (-110)**: Playoff games (assuming these are playoffs in May) tend to be more defensive-oriented, especially in close matchups. All bookmakers agree on this total, suggesting it's a fair number, but playoff unders can still provide value.

3. **Nuggets +7 (-110) at DraftKings**: This is a half-point better than the +7.5 offered elsewhere for similar odds. While the Thunder are favored, 7 points is a significant cushion in what might be a playoff game.

4. **Nuggets-Thunder Under 212.5 (-105) at BetMGM**: This offers the best odds for the under, and playoff games can trend lower scoring, especially when the favorite is expected to control the pace.

Without more information on lineups, injuries, and team form, these recommendations are primarily based on finding the best available odds and general playoff basketball tendencies. I would assign moderate stake levels (2-3 units) due to the limited information available.

Let me prepare the final recommendations table based on this analysis.
