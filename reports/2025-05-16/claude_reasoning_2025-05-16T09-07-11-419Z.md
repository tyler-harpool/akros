Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the two NBA games: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets.

First, let's organize what we know about each game.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/17/2025)

### Odds Summary:
- **Moneyline**: Boston is favored (-142 to -148) vs New York (+120 to +126)
- **Spread**: Boston -2.5 points (with odds ranging from -110 to -114)
- **Total Points**: 210-211 points (varying slightly by bookmaker)

### What We Know:
- No lineup information is available
- No injury information is provided
- No statistical edges were detected in the betting markets

### Analysis:
The bookmakers have Boston as modest favorites in this matchup, with a fairly tight spread of only 2.5 points. This suggests the bookmakers view this as a competitive game with Boston having a slight edge. The total points line around 210-211 indicates expectations of a moderate-scoring game, not particularly high or low by NBA standards.

Without lineup and injury information, I need to rely on the odds provided to make my assessment. The consistency of the lines across bookmakers suggests market efficiency - there are no major discrepancies to exploit. However, I can look for the best available odds if I have a view on the game outcome.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)

### Odds Summary:
- **Moneyline**: Oklahoma City is heavily favored (-278 to -295) vs Denver (+225 to +240)
- **Spread**: Oklahoma City favored by 7-7.5 points
- **Total Points**: 212-212.5 points

### What We Know:
- No lineup information is available
- No injury information is provided
- No statistical edges were detected in the betting markets

### Analysis:
Oklahoma City is a strong favorite at home against Denver, with a significant 7-7.5 point spread. This indicates bookmakers expect Oklahoma City to win comfortably. The totals line is similar to the Celtics-Knicks game, suggesting a moderate-scoring affair.

Again, without lineup and injury information, I must rely on the odds structure. The slightly different spread between DraftKings (-7) and the other bookmakers (-7.5) could be worth exploring if I have a view on Denver's ability to cover.

## Overall Betting Strategy

Since no significant edges are detected and we lack lineup/injury information, I need to be selective and focus on finding potential value based on the odds structure and my basketball knowledge:

1. **Look for best available odds** for any bet I want to make
2. **Consider small edges** in the spread or total points markets
3. **Factor in home court advantage** and how it might impact the games
4. **Consider line shopping** between bookmakers for the most favorable odds

Now, let me formulate 3-5 specific betting recommendations based on the information available.

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- The tight spread suggests a competitive game
- FanDuel offers the best odds for New York (+126) if I believe they can win outright
- BetMGM and DraftKings offer better spread odds for New York at +2.5 (-110)
- The totals are fairly consistent, with FanDuel offering slightly better value on the Under at -108

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets
- DraftKings offers the best spread for Denver at +7 (-110), which is more favorable than the +7.5 at other books
- FanDuel offers better moneyline odds for Denver at +240
- For totals, FanDuel offers better value on the Under at -106

Based on this analysis, here are my recommended bets:

1. **New York Knicks Moneyline** (FanDuel, +126): If I believe New York has a good chance to win outright, this offers the best value.
2. **Denver Nuggets +7** (DraftKings, -110): Getting an extra half point on the spread compared to other bookmakers provides value.
3. **Under 212 points** in Thunder-Nuggets (FanDuel, -106): Best odds for the under across bookmakers.
4. **Under 210 points** in Celtics-Knicks (FanDuel, -108): Best odds for the under in this game.

Without more information on lineups, injuries, and team form, these recommendations are based primarily on odds comparison and some basic basketball insights about home court advantage and typical playoff game dynamics (if these are playoff games, which seems likely given the timing in May).

Let me now formulate these into the required recommendation format.
