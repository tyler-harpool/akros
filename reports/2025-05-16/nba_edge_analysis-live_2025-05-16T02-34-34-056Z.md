## Current Game State Analysis

Looking at the Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder game that's currently in progress, I need to analyze the betting lines to infer the current game state and identify potential value.

Based on the betting lines:
- The Nuggets are currently favored by 5.5-6.5 points, suggesting they likely have a moderate lead
- Moneyline odds (-250 to -340 for Denver) indicate bookmakers are giving Denver a 71-77% chance to win
- The total points line of 226.5-227.5 suggests a fairly average-paced game
- FanDuel offering +110 for Nuggets -6.5 is unusual and indicates potential value

Both teams have their key players available:
- Denver has Jokic, Murray, Porter, Gordon, and Braun starting
- OKC has SGA, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, and Hartenstein starting

The line discrepancies between sportsbooks suggest some disagreement about how this game will finish, creating potential opportunities.
