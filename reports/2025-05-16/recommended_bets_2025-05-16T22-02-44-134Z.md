## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +2.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Best available odds for the spread; playoff games are typically tighter with underdogs covering at higher rates. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 211.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Playoff games tend to feature stronger defensive intensity and lower scoring, especially in competitive matchups. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +7 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other bookmakers' +7.5 lines; key number in basketball that could prove valuable. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 212.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best odds available for the under; playoff favorites often control pace leading to lower-scoring games. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +240 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | While Thunder are substantial favorites, this offers significant underdog value for a playoff-caliber Denver team capable of pulling an upset. |

The recommended approach favors taking advantage of the best available odds across different bookmakers while accounting for typical playoff basketball tendencies.
