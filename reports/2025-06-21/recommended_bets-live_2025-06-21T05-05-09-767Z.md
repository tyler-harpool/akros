## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | 260 | 2 | BetMGM offers the best price on the underdog. If the game is within striking distance, this provides significant value compared to the spread. Live moneyline odds for underdogs often overreact to current game flow. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -106 | 3 | FanDuel offers the best price on Thunder to cover. If OKC is already establishing control or has momentum, this represents good value with reduced juice compared to other books. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers both the best price and the lower total. Live betting often presents value on unders as defensive intensity increases in competitive games, especially in second half situations. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 215 | -110 | 2 | If the pace is fast and scoring is efficient, FanDuel's extra half-point provides insurance against a 215 exact landing. Consider this if teams are shooting well above expected percentages. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds shift rapidly. Without specific game state information, these recommendations focus on the best current price values rather than reactions to specific game developments.
