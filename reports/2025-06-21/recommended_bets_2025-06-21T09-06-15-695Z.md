## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 3 units | 7.5 points provides solid cushion in a potential late-game scenario where Indiana could cover even in defeat |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best odds available on the Under, which often offers value without specific lineup information |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +260 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | Maximum value for underdog play with BetMGM offering the best odds; small stake reflects higher risk |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Best value if backing the favorite to cover; FanDuel offers superior odds compared to other bookmakers |

Note that these recommendations would be more refined with information about team form, lineup configurations, and injury situations. Consider these factors before placing any bets.
