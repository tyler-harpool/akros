## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -285 | 3 | Best price available for the favorite across all bookmakers; represents better implied probability value than FanDuel or BetMGM offers |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel offers the best price for this spread, a 4-point advantage over BetMGM's -110 for the same bet |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best value with reduced juice compared to standard -110 pricing elsewhere |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Pacers +7.5 | -110 | 1 | BetMGM offers the best price for backing the underdog with the points; hedge against a competitive game |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +260 | 1 | If considering an underdog play, BetMGM provides significantly better odds than competitors; low-stake value opportunity |

Note: Given the limited information about team lineups, injuries, and recent form, these recommendations focus on identifying the best available prices rather than specific matchup advantages. The stakes reflect confidence based on price value rather than team analysis.
