## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 4 units | The single point spread significantly undervalues Lakers' home court advantage in a showcase game; line should be closer to -3 based on typical home edge |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -105 | 3 units | Excellent value getting 5 points with Minnesota in what projects as a competitive divisional matchup; FanDuel's tighter spread suggests market uncertainty |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers (12/25/2025) | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 3 units | Knicks traditionally elevate their performance at MSG during Christmas games; spread doesn't adequately account for home court emotional advantage |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 2 units | Both teams feature high-powered offenses and Christmas games historically trend toward higher scoring due to showcase environment and defensive intensity drops |
| Celtics vs 76ers (10/22/2025) | Spread | 76ers +2 | -110 | 2 units | Early season matchup between rivals often produces tight contests; getting a full 2 points provides cushion in a game likely to be decided by a single possession |

While no lineup or injury information is currently available for these future games, these selections represent value based on team trajectories, historical matchup data, and identified market inefficiencies in the betting lines.
