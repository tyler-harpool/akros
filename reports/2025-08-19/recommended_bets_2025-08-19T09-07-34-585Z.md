## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/2025) | Total | Over 222 | -110 | 4 | Both teams feature elite offensive talent (Tatum, Brown, Embiid, Maxey) and early-season games typically favor offense before defensive systems get established. This total appears 3-4 points too low based on expected pace and scoring efficiency. |
| Detroit Pistons vs Cleveland Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers -1.5 | -110 | 3 | Cleveland projects as the significantly stronger team with minimal spread to cover. Detroit's rebuilding roster should struggle against the Cavs' established core, making this small road favorite line particularly valuable. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 4 | Christmas Day games historically stay closer than regular season matchups. With Wembanyama having another year of development and the national spotlight, expect San Antonio to keep this showcase game competitive. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 | 3 | Houston's young core should be significantly improved by December, while the Lakers may struggle with consistency and rest issues. This small spread offers value for a Rockets team likely to be on an upward trajectory. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 | Golden State receiving points at Chase Center presents strong value. The Warriors' home court advantage typically gives them a 3-4 point edge, making them getting a point as home underdogs an opportunity worth exploiting. |

These recommendations balance early season opportunities with strategic positioning on showcase games where market inefficiencies are most likely to appear. Each selection represents a situation where the current odds don't fully reflect the game dynamics or team capabilities that my analysis suggests will be in play.
