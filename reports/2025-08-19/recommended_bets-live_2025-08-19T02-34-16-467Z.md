## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Live Spread | Trailing team +5.5 or better | -110 | 3 | With a pre-game spread of only 1 point, any team building a 6+ point lead presents value on the trailing team as this projects as an extremely close game |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers | Live Moneyline | Celtics if trailing by 5+ | 120 | 4 | Celtics are the pre-game favorite (-130) but if they fall behind early, their ML would offer significant value as they have demonstrated strong comeback ability |
| Memphis Grizzlies vs New Orleans Pelicans | Live Under | Under if pace exceeds 105 in 1Q | -110 | 3 | This high total (238) will likely adjust higher if teams start hot, creating value on the under as defenses typically tighten as the game progresses |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Team Total | Warriors Over if under 25 in 1Q | -110 | 3 | Warriors are known for poor first quarters followed by explosive scoring runs, creating value on their team total over if they start cold |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Rockets +9.5 or better if trailing | -110 | 2 | Pre-game spread is 6.5, so any additional value if Rockets fall behind early presents opportunity as they've shown ability to keep games competitive |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds shift rapidly. Look for significant deviations from pre-game expectations, especially in games with tight spreads where momentum shifts can create overreactions in the live markets.
