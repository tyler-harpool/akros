## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -118 | 3 units | The moneyline suggests an even matchup (-110 both ways), but getting a point with the Spurs provides valuable cushion. By 2025, San Antonio's young core should be significantly developed, potentially making this spread excellent value. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24/2025) | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 | 3 units | Warriors' home-court advantage is worth more than a single point. The near-even odds (-105) provide strong value for what should be a significant edge at Chase Center against a perennial Western Conference rival. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/2025) | Total | Under 219.5 | -110 | 4 units | LA derbies historically feature increased defensive intensity. The 219.5 total appears inflated for an intra-city rivalry that typically sees heightened defensive effort and more deliberate possessions. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Rockets -1 | -110 | 2 units | The Rockets being road favorites on the moneyline (-115) indicates strong market confidence in Houston's progression by late 2025. The -1 spread offers slightly better odds for essentially the same position. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/25/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers +2.5 | -110 | 3 units | Christmas Day games tend to be competitive and unpredictable. The 2.5-point cushion with Cleveland provides significant value against a Knicks team that may face added pressure performing at Madison Square Garden during the marquee holiday showcase. |

These recommendations are based on projected team trajectories, historical matchup data, and identifying potential market inefficiencies in the current odds structure. All stakes reflect confidence levels on a 1-5 unit scale.
