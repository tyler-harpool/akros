## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -112 | 3 | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's line offers protection against key number; home underdogs often perform better than expected |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +172 | 1 | Home court advantage provides value at this price; implied probability seems slightly lower than realistic win chances |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5 | -110 | 2 | Better value than DraftKings' -5.5 line if backing Thunder; strong road favorites often justify their status |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 | 2 | Without lineup information, the conservative play is the under; playoff-like intensity (June game) typically leads to tighter defense |

These recommendations leverage the line shopping opportunities and maximize value based on the available information. The strongest play is Pacers +5.5, which gives you the benefit of the key number compared to other available options.
