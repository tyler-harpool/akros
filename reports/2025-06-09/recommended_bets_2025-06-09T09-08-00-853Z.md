## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 3 | The 1-point spread difference between bookmakers creates value. DraftKings offers the extra point of protection at a reasonable price. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -200 (FanDuel) | 2 | If backing the favorite, FanDuel offers significantly better value than DraftKings (-200 vs -218). |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Middle Opportunity | Pacers +5.5 & Thunder -4.5 | -112/-114 | 1 | Small stake on both Pacers +5.5 (DraftKings) and Thunder -4.5 (FanDuel) for potential middle win if Thunder wins by exactly 5. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 (Either) | 2 | Without lineup information, slight lean to the under as totals tend to be slightly overvalued in the betting market. |

Note: These recommendations are based primarily on odds analysis rather than team-specific factors, due to the limited information available. Consider current team form, lineup news, and injury updates before placing these bets.
