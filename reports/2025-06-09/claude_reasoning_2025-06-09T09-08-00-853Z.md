Let me analyze the betting opportunity for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for June 12, 2025.

First, let's organize what we know:

## Game Information:
- Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Game Date: June 12, 2025
- Time: 12:35:00 AM

## Betting Lines:

### Moneyline:
- DraftKings: Thunder -218, Pacers +180
- FanDuel: Thunder -200, Pacers +168

This suggests that Oklahoma City is a significant favorite. The slight difference between bookmakers (Thunder at -218 vs -200) might be worth noting.

### Spread:
- DraftKings: Thunder -5.5 (-108), Pacers +5.5 (-112)
- FanDuel: Thunder -4.5 (-114), Pacers +4.5 (-106)

Interesting discrepancy here - FanDuel has the spread at 4.5 while DraftKings has it at 5.5. This is significant because 5 is a common margin of victory in basketball.

### Totals:
- Both bookmakers have the total at 228.5 with -110 on both over and under

## Lineups and Injuries:
Unfortunately, we don't have lineup or injury information, which significantly limits our analysis.

## Analysis:

Without specific lineup, injury, or team statistical data, I need to focus on the betting market inefficiencies suggested by the odds differences.

The most significant discrepancy is in the spread market:
- DraftKings: Thunder -5.5 (-108)
- FanDuel: Thunder -4.5 (-114)

There's a full point difference here, which is substantial in NBA betting. This creates a potential middle opportunity (where you could win both bets if the game lands on a specific margin).

Let's consider the value in each market:

1. **Moneyline:** Thunder are heavy favorites, but the odds difference between bookmakers isn't significant enough to create clear arbitrage. However, FanDuel offers slightly better value on the Thunder (-200 vs -218).

2. **Spread:** The 1-point difference between bookmakers creates value. If you believe the game will be close, taking Pacers +4.5 at FanDuel (-106) has value. If you believe the Thunder will win comfortably, their -5.5 line at DraftKings (-108) is reasonable compared to the -4.5 (-114) at FanDuel.

3. **Totals:** Both bookmakers have identical lines, so no clear edge.

The lack of team information makes this analysis challenging. Without knowing current form, injuries, lineup configurations, or recent performance trends, I can only provide recommendations based on the line discrepancies.

Given the information available, I'll focus on identifying the best value based on the odds differences between bookmakers and standard NBA betting principles.

For my recommendations, I'll consider:
1. The middle opportunity on the spread (Pacers +5.5 and Thunder -4.5)
2. The slight moneyline value on Thunder at FanDuel vs DraftKings
3. Standard total betting strategy based on the 228.5 line

Let me formulate my specific recommendations:
