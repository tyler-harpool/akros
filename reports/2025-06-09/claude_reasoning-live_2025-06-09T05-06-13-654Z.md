Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the upcoming NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder scheduled for June 12, 2025.

First, let's review the key information provided:

## Game: Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Date: June 12, 2025, 12:35:00 AM

## Betting Lines:
### Moneyline Odds:
- DraftKings: Indiana +164, OKC -198
- FanDuel: Indiana +176, OKC -210

### Spread Odds:
- DraftKings: Indiana +5 (-110), OKC -5 (-110)
- FanDuel: Indiana +4.5 (-106), OKC -4.5 (-114)

### Totals (Over/Under):
- DraftKings: 228 (-110 both sides)
- FanDuel: 228.5 (-110 both sides)

Missing information:
- No lineup data for either team
- No injury information
- No statistical edges detected in the current betting markets
- No information about the current score, quarter, or time remaining
- No information about season performance, head-to-head matchups, or other contextual data

This appears to be a live in-game betting scenario, but I don't have the current game state, which makes it challenging to provide accurate recommendations.

Let's work with what we do have:

1. OKC is favored in both moneyline and spread markets
2. The spread is around 4.5-5 points in favor of OKC
3. The total is set at 228-228.5 points

Since this is a live in-game betting analysis, I should focus on how the current game dynamics might create value. However, without knowing the current score, time remaining, momentum shifts, or player performance in the current game, my analysis will be limited.

Let's analyze the market inefficiencies:

1. There are slight differences in the odds between DraftKings and FanDuel, which could potentially be exploited:
   - Moneyline: FanDuel offers better value on Indiana (+176 vs +164)
   - Spread: FanDuel offers Indiana +4.5 at -106 compared to DraftKings' +5 at -110 (DraftKings gives a better spread but at slightly worse odds)
   - Totals: FanDuel has a slightly higher total (228.5 vs 228)

2. The odds suggest OKC is the favorite, but not overwhelmingly so. A 4.5-5 point spread indicates the bookmakers see this as a competitive game.

Given the limited information, I can make some general recommendations based on the market discrepancies and logical basketball betting principles. However, these would be more reliable with current game state information.

For the RECOMMENDED BETS section, I'll focus on the value presented by the differences between sportsbooks and logical inferences from the lines themselves.

Here are my recommendations:

1. Consider betting on Indiana Pacers moneyline at FanDuel (+176) if there's reason to believe the game is close or Indiana has momentum. The +176 offers better value than DraftKings' +164.

2. If backing OKC, use DraftKings (-198) rather than FanDuel (-210) for better value.

3. For spread betting on Indiana, FanDuel offers +4.5 at -106, which provides slightly better odds than DraftKings' +5 at -110. However, the extra half-point from DraftKings could be valuable in a close game.

4. For totals, the half-point difference between DraftKings (228) and FanDuel (228.5) could be significant. If betting the under, FanDuel's higher line at 228.5 gives a better cushion. If betting the over, DraftKings' 228 is easier to hit.

I'll structure these into the required format, but note that the recommendations are very limited without current game information. 

Actually, looking back at the instructions again, I see this is a LIVE in-game betting analysis. The problem is that I don't have any information about the current game state - the score, time remaining, player performance, momentum, etc. This makes it extremely difficult to provide meaningful live betting recommendations.

Given the significant limitations, I should acknowledge this in my response while still attempting to provide some value based on the odds discrepancies between sportsbooks. My recommendations will need to be heavily caveated.

Since I don't have live game data, I'll have to base my recommendations on the odds differences between sportsbooks and some general principles of in-game betting, with the caveat that these recommendations should be considered in light of the actual game situation.
