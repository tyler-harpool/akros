# NBA LIVE BETTING Betting Recommendations

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND (IN PROGRESS) | Total | Under 226.5 | +102 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: FanDuel's line is 4 points lower than DraftKings with significantly better odds. With OKC leading big, expect pace to slow and scoring to decrease as bench players enter. |
| OKC vs IND (IN PROGRESS) | Spread | Pacers +17.5 | +108 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Large leads often shrink in garbage time as starters rest. The 17.5-point cushion provides value, especially with plus-money odds. |
| IND vs OKC (6/12) | Spread | Pacers +3.5 | -106 | 3 | FanDuel's spread is 2 points better than DraftKings' +5.5 line - a significant edge on a home team looking to bounce back after likely losing the current game. |
| IND vs OKC (6/12) | Moneyline | Thunder | -180 | 2 | Significantly better value than DraftKings' -218 for the same bet. If OKC is demonstrating dominance in the current game, they'll likely carry momentum into the next matchup. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so these recommendations are time-sensitive and should be acted upon promptly if you find them valuable.
