Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for June 12, 2025. I'll need to examine the available betting lines, consider team dynamics, and identify potential edges, despite limited information on lineups and injuries.

First, let's summarize what we know from the data provided:

1. Game: Indiana Pacers (home) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (away)
2. Date/Time: June 12, 2025, 12:35:00 AM

Betting lines:
- Moneyline: 
  - Indiana: +170 (DraftKings), +172 (FanDuel)
  - OKC: -205 (both DraftKings and FanDuel)
  
- Spread:
  - DraftKings: OKC -5.5 (-108), Indiana +5.5 (-112)
  - FanDuel: OKC -5 (-110), Indiana +5 (-110)
  
- Totals:
  - Both bookmakers have the total at 228.5 with -110 for both over and under

Unfortunately, we don't have:
- Starting lineups for either team
- Injury information
- Statistical edges identified in the analysis
- Recent form or team statistics
- Head-to-head history

Given these limitations, I'll need to analyze the betting lines themselves and look for any discrepancies or value opportunities.

**Moneyline Analysis:**
The moneyline odds are very consistent across the two bookmakers. OKC is a clear favorite at -205, while Indiana is around +170/+172 as the home underdog. These odds imply:
- OKC has approximately a 67% chance of winning
- Indiana has approximately a 37% chance of winning
(Note: The combined probabilities exceed 100% due to the bookmaker's margin)

**Spread Analysis:**
There's a slight discrepancy in the spread between bookmakers:
- DraftKings has OKC -5.5 points
- FanDuel has OKC -5 points

This half-point difference could be significant, especially in a close game. FanDuel's line of -5 for OKC is more favorable if betting on OKC, while DraftKings' +5.5 for Indiana offers better value if betting on the Pacers.

**Totals Analysis:**
Both bookmakers agree on the total at 228.5 points with standard -110 juice on both sides.

**Finding Value:**
1. The half-point difference in the spread between bookmakers creates a potential middle opportunity. If the game lands exactly on OKC winning by 5 points, a bettor could win on both FanDuel (OKC -5) and DraftKings (Indiana +5.5).

2. With the limited information available, the best value might be found in the spread market due to the discrepancy between bookmakers.

Since I don't have specific team information to analyze matchups, recent form, or injuries, I'll need to be somewhat conservative in my recommendations. However, I can still identify value based on the lines themselves and general NBA betting principles.

Let me formulate my recommended bets:

1. **Middle Opportunity**: Bet on OKC -5 at FanDuel and Indiana +5.5 at DraftKings. This creates a potential win-win situation if OKC wins by exactly 5 points, though it requires two separate bets.

2. **Line Shopping Value**: Indiana +5.5 (-112) at DraftKings offers better value than +5 (-110) at FanDuel if backing the Pacers.

3. **Home Underdog Value**: Indiana at +172 (FanDuel) moneyline could offer value, as home underdogs in the NBA often perform better than expected, especially with the home court advantage.

4. **Totals Consideration**: Without specific team data, it's difficult to have a strong opinion on the total. However, the consistency across bookmakers suggests this is a fair line.

For my final recommendations, I'll focus on the options that provide the clearest value based on the limited information available.
