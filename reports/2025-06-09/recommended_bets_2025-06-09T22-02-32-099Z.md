## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5 | -106 | 3 | The half-point advantage over DraftKings' line (+5.5) provides significant value in what could be a close game |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 | 2 | Taking the higher total line gives us more cushion in a potentially defensive matchup |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread Alt | Thunder -3.5 | -150* | 2 | Buying points down from -5 creates value if Thunder win by 4+ but fail to cover the full spread |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder ML | -215 | 1 | Although price is steep, the implied 68% win probability appears reasonable for the favored Thunder |

*Estimated alternate line odds

Without more specific team information, these recommendations focus primarily on finding value in the line discrepancies between bookmakers and maximizing our mathematical edge in a relatively efficient market.
