## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best price in market; NBA games often tighten in later stages regardless of talent disparity |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder ML | -395 (DraftKings) | 2 | If Thunder maintaining control, this represents best available price for the favorite |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 223 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 | Games frequently slow down in late stages due to intentional fouls and clock management |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +340 (FanDuel) | 1 | Small-value opportunity if game is closer than odds suggest; best underdog price available |

I've recommended a mix of bets that provide value regardless of the current game state. Without knowing the specific game situation, I've prioritized the best available odds while considering common NBA game flow patterns. Adjust stake sizes based on the current score and momentum when placing these bets.
