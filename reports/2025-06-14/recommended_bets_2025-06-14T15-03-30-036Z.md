## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Over 223.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best price available on this total; both teams likely feature offensive-minded players like SGA and Haliburton who can push scoring pace |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Best value on Pacers spread; large spreads often provide backdoor cover opportunities, especially with Pacers' offensive capabilities |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 223 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Half-point advantage compared to other books; creates middle opportunity when paired with Over 223.5 |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +340 (FanDuel) | 1 | Small-value flyer on the underdog at best available odds; implied probability (22.7%) may undervalue Pacers' upset potential |

While working with limited lineup and injury information, these recommendations focus on identifying the best available odds across markets and potential value opportunities based on the line discrepancies between bookmakers.
