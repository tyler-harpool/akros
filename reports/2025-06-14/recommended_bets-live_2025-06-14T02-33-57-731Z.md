## Saturday, June 14, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +2.5 | +100 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Even money odds provide strong value on a tight spread. IN-GAME recommendation as FanDuel's line offers better value than competitors. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder ML | -154 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Significant price gap between DK (-154) and FanDuel (-184) indicates value. IN-GAME pick exploiting bookmaker disagreement. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total Points | Under 228.5 | -118 (BetMGM) | 2 units | With BetMGM offering the highest total line among bookmakers, this creates value opportunity. IN-GAME recommendation taking advantage of line discrepancy. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -2.5 | -125 (DraftKings) | 1 unit | DraftKings offers better value than FanDuel's -132 for the same line. IN-GAME recommendation based on current pricing inefficiency. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so these recommendations are time-sensitive. Consider the current game state, momentum, and time remaining when placing these bets.
