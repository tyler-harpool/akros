Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the upcoming NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers on June 17, 2025.

First, let's gather what information we have:

1. Game: Oklahoma City Thunder (home) vs Indiana Pacers (away)
2. Date/Time: June 17, 2025, 12:35:00 AM

Betting Lines:
- Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-395 to -450) vs Pacers (+310 to +350)
- Spread: Thunder -9.5 across all bookmakers
- Totals: Range from 222.5 to 223.5 points

No betting edge analysis is provided, and we don't have lineup information or injury reports.

Let's think through what we can analyze with this limited information:

1. Odds Comparison Across Bookmakers:
   - Moneyline: Best value for Thunder is DraftKings (-395), best for Pacers is FanDuel (+350)
   - Spread: All bookmakers have -9.5, but FanDuel offers slightly better value for Pacers at -108
   - Totals: There's a 1-point difference between the lowest (222.5 at DraftKings) and highest (223.5 at BetMGM) total
   - BetMGM offers slightly better value on the over at -105 compared to the standard -110

2. Market Consensus:
   - There's strong consensus that OKC is a significant favorite
   - The 9.5-point spread is consistent across bookmakers
   - The total points expectation is in a tight range of 222.5-223.5

3. Implied Probabilities:
   - DraftKings Thunder Moneyline (-395): Implied probability = 395/(395+100) ≈ 79.8%
   - FanDuel Pacers Moneyline (+350): Implied probability = 100/(350+100) ≈ 22.2%
   - Note the slight overround in these markets

Without lineup data, injury information, or recent team performance, my analysis is limited. However, I can still offer some betting recommendations based on the odds comparisons and market inefficiencies:

Potential Recommendations:

1. If betting on Thunder Moneyline: Use DraftKings (-395) for best value
2. If betting on Pacers Moneyline: Use FanDuel (+350) for best value
3. If betting on Pacers ATS: Use FanDuel (+9.5 at -108) for slightly better value
4. If betting on Over: Use BetMGM (223.5 at -105) for higher line and better odds
5. If betting on Under: Use DraftKings (222.5 at -110) for lower line at standard odds

Given the lack of team-specific information, I'll focus my recommendations on odds value rather than team performance factors. I'll also be somewhat conservative with stake recommendations due to the limited information.

Let me prepare my final recommendations:
