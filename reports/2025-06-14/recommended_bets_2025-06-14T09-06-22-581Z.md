## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -395 (DraftKings) | 3 | Best available price on Thunder by a significant margin compared to -450 elsewhere |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Best value on the underdog spread with slightly better odds than the standard -110 |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 223.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Higher total line with better odds (-105 vs -110) offers superior expected value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +350 (FanDuel) | 1 | Small-stake value play on underdog at the best available price in the market |

My recommendations focus on exploiting the odds disparities between bookmakers rather than team-specific factors, given the absence of lineup and injury information. The Thunder moneyline at DraftKings offers particularly notable value compared to other bookmakers, while the small-stake play on the Pacers at +350 acknowledges the underdog potential with an appealing payout structure.
