## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best spread value available; large spreads tend to favor underdogs historically as games often tighten in closing minutes |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 223.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Best price on the under; playoff-atmosphere games often feature tighter defense and lower scoring |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 (DraftKings) | 1 | Small-value flyer with strong ROI potential; underdogs of this magnitude win approximately 20-25% of NBA games |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -175 (DraftKings) | 4 | Buying down the spread increases win probability significantly while maintaining reasonable odds value |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management and only wager what you can afford to lose. These recommendations are based on the limited information available without team lineup details.
