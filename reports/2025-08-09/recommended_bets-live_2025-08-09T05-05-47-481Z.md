## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets (10/22) | Live Spread | Thunder -4.5 | -110 | 3 | Thunder historically cover when favored by 6+ points. In live scenarios where line drops below 5, strong value if OKC has key players performing well. |
| Lakers vs Warriors (10/22) | Live Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 2 | Late-night West Coast games between rivals often tighten defensively as game progresses. If pace slows in 2nd half, under becomes valuable. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers (12/26) | Live Spread | Cavaliers +3 | -108 | 3 | Cavs typically perform well as underdogs and line suggests close game. If Knicks lead early but Cavs showing shooting efficiency, take the points. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26) | Live ML | Rockets | -102 | 4 | Nearly even odds suggests market uncertainty. Young Rockets team with high variance - if showing good ball movement and hitting shots, strong value at these odds. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26) | Live Total | Over 229 | -110 | 3 | Both teams have elite offensive talent. If combined first quarter scoring is 57+ points, trend likely continues, making over valuable. |

When making live bets, wait for clear indicators that align with these recommendations. Live betting requires quick assessment of how current game flow either validates or invalidates the pre-game expectations reflected in these lines.
