## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 | 4 units | Full point advantage compared to DraftKings' +3.5 line, creating significant middle opportunity if Warriors win by exactly 4 |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 | 3 units | Clear price advantage over DraftKings' -155 line while backing the favored home team |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -105 | 3 units | Half-point better than FanDuel's +4.5 spread with more favorable odds (-105 vs -112) |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Totals | Under 225.5 | -110 | 2 units | One-point higher than DraftKings' 224.5 line, creating value on the higher number |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Totals | Over 227 | -112 | 2 units | Significant 1.5-point difference compared to FanDuel's 228.5 line suggests value on the lower total |

These recommendations focus on exploiting the price and line discrepancies between bookmakers, which represents one of the most reliable edges in sports betting. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each opportunity, with higher stakes assigned to bets with larger line advantages.
