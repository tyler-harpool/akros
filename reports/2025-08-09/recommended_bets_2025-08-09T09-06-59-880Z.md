## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Full point advantage over DraftKings' line (+3.5). The extra cushion significantly improves win probability in what should be a competitive Western Conference matchup. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 (FanDuel) | 4 | Substantial price improvement over DraftKings' -155, representing approximately 2.5% better implied probability for the same outcome. Home court advantage should be significant in this matchup. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves | Total | Under 230.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | The 1.5 point higher total on FanDuel creates value opportunity. These teams historically play at a slower pace when matching up, and defensive intensity tends to increase in meaningful conference games. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 (DraftKings) | 3 | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's -1.5 line is significant in projected close game. The smaller spread requirement dramatically increases win probability in what the market suggests will be a one-possession game. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs | Total | Over 227 | -112 (DraftKings) | 2 | The 1.5 point lower total compared to FanDuel creates value. Thunder's offensive firepower against Spurs' developing defense should create scoring opportunities throughout the game. |

Remember to always manage your bankroll responsibly and consider late-breaking lineup news before placing your wagers.
