## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +31.5 | -115 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Garbage time typically leads to reduced defensive intensity. With Cleveland likely resting starters and emptying the bench, Pacers' second unit should be able to avoid losing by more than 30+ points. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: With a blowout in progress, pace typically slows significantly in the final quarter. Both teams will likely empty benches, leading to less efficient offense and clock-burning possessions. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -110 | 2 | Golden State's home court advantage is significant, and their offensive firepower should keep this game competitive. Minnesota has struggled historically at Chase Center. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Totals | Under 208.5 | -110 | 3 | This playoff matchup features two defensively-focused teams. The Knicks play at one of the slowest paces in the league, and playoff intensity typically reduces scoring efficiency. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder -10.5 | -105 | 2 | Oklahoma City's youth and athleticism should overwhelm Denver, who may be showing fatigue. The Thunder's home court advantage has been significant this season, with several double-digit wins against quality opponents. |

When placing live bets, remember that timing is critical as odds can shift rapidly in response to game events. The Pacers-Cavaliers recommendations are based on the current game state and typical late-game dynamics in blowout situations.
