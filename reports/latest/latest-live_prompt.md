3. Consider how fatigue and foul trouble may impact the remainder of the game
4. Focus on total points markets that might not account for pace changes
5. Be selective and only recommend high-confidence live opportunities

For live bets, be sure to note that these are IN-GAME recommendations in the Reasoning column.
