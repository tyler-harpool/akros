## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves -5.5 | -110 | 4 units | Curry's absence severely limits Golden State's offensive creation and scoring ability. Minnesota's defense should capitalize against a depleted Warriors offense. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -6 | -115 | 3 units | OKC offers value at this spread on DraftKings, as they match up well against Denver's frontcourt and should control the tempo at home. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Cavaliers -4.5 | -112 | 3 units | Best spread value among bookmakers on DraftKings, with Cleveland's defensive strength positioned to contain Indiana's fast-paced attack. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Totals | Over 230.5 | -115 | 2 units | Both teams play at a high pace, with Indiana pushing tempo and Cleveland having enough offensive weapons to contribute to a high-scoring affair. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Totals | Under 219.5 | -120 | 1 unit | With such a lopsided matchup, game flow will likely be disrupted. Boston may rest starters early if they build a large lead, leading to a slower-paced fourth quarter. |

Remember to consider your own risk tolerance and bankroll management when placing these bets, and always bet responsibly.
