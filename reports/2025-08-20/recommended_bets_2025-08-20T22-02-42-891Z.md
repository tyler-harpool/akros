## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Mavericks vs Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -102 | 4 units | Spurs' young core led by Wembanyama should be significantly improved by 2025, while bookmakers are pricing this as a toss-up. Home court advantage against an even money spread provides excellent value. |
| Thunder vs Rockets (10/21/25) | Total | Under 224.5 | -110 | 3 units | Season openers often feature tighter defense and less fluid offenses. OKC projects as an elite defensive team by 2025, and this total appears inflated for an opening night contest. |
| Lakers vs Timberwolves (10/25/25) | Spread | Timberwolves +2.5 | -110 | 3 units | Minnesota's frontcourt strength matches up well against the Lakers' traditional weaknesses. Lakers home games often have inflated lines due to public betting, creating value on the underdog. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -108 | 3 units | FanDuel offers better value than DraftKings (-5 at -112). Denver's home court advantage at altitude is significant, especially in a post-Christmas game where Minnesota may be on a back-to-back after their Lakers matchup. |
| Warriors vs Rockets (11/27/25) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 | 2 units | Getting the Warriors at home for essentially even money provides value. Golden State's experience should prevail in what bookmakers see as a toss-up, particularly in a Thanksgiving showcase game where veteran teams typically perform well. |

These recommendations balance the available odds information with projected team development paths and situational advantages. As we get closer to these games, injury reports and lineup configurations would further refine these assessments.
