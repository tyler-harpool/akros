## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Bulls vs Pistons (10/23/2025) | Moneyline | Pistons | -130 | 3 | Road team favored suggests significant talent gap that outweighs home court; Bulls appear undervalued by oddsmakers |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -105 | 2 | Christmas Day games historically see inflated spreads due to public money on favorites; Spurs should keep this competitive on national stage |
| Warriors vs Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Rockets +1 | -110 | 3 | Near pick'em matchup with value on Houston in what should be a competitive game; line suggests Warriors getting home-court premium only |
| Lakers vs Clippers (11/26/2025) | Total | Over 219.5 | -110 | 2 | LA rivalry games typically feature higher scoring than average; both teams likely to push pace in high-profile matchup |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | +110 | 2 | Tight spread in this Eastern Conference rivalry suggests value on underdog 76ers; Boston laying only 2 points indicates a coin-flip matchup |

I'll continue monitoring these lines for movement as we approach game day and as team information becomes available.
