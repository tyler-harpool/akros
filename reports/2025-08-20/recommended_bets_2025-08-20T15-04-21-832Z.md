## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant pricing discrepancy between bookmakers (DK: -218, FD: -190). Denver's home court advantage at altitude historically provides strong edge, and this is likely undervalued in the FanDuel line. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/25) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 3 | Christmas showcase games often feature more competitive play from underdogs. The 9.5-point spread is excessive for a nationally televised game where the Spurs will be highly motivated. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/25) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 | 3 | Warriors getting essentially even money at home offers significant value. Golden State has historically maintained one of the strongest home court advantages in the NBA, and this pricing suggests the market is undervaluing it. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/25) | Moneyline | Celtics | -130 | 3 | Early season matchup between conference rivals where Boston's home court edge is undervalued. The 2-point spread indicates a tight game, but Boston has historically performed well as slight home favorites against conference opponents. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder (1/19/26) | Spread | Cavaliers -1 | -105 | 2 | This MLK Day showcase game features a near pick'em spread. The Cavaliers should benefit from the home court advantage, and the -105 price offers slight value in what projects to be a competitive matchup. |

Remember that these recommendations are based on current odds and would need to be reassessed closer to game time when lineup information, team form, and injury reports become available.
