## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Cavaliers @ Knicks | Spread | Cavaliers +3 | -108 | 3 | Line discrepancy between books suggests value; DraftKings offers a full 3 points compared to FanDuel's 2.5 with favorable odds |
| Timberwolves @ Nuggets | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -105 | 3 | Better spread value on DraftKings compared to FanDuel's 4.5; the -105 price offers additional value |
| Lakers @ Rockets | Moneyline | Rockets | 104 | 2 | Near pick'em odds for a home team creates value; FanDuel offers better price than DraftKings (-102) |
| Spurs @ Thunder | Total | Under 227 | -108 | 2 | Value identified in the 1.5 point total discrepancy between books; DraftKings offers better position on the under |
| Warriors @ Lakers | Total | Under 224.5 | -110 | 2 | Line shopping advantage with FanDuel's lower total compared to DraftKings (225.5) |

Note: These recommendations are based on pre-game odds since live game data isn't available. When betting live games, always factor in current score, momentum, foul trouble, and tactical adjustments before placing wagers.
