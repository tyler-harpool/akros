## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 (FanDuel) | 3 | Significant 13-point price differential between bookmakers (-155 vs -142) indicates value. Knicks typically perform well at home in holiday games at MSG. |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Total | Under 224.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 4 | One-point advantage over FanDuel's line (225.5). OKC's defensive identity should control tempo against a Houston team that typically struggles on the road. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 3 | 15-point price differential between bookmakers represents clear value. Denver's home court advantage at altitude is historically strong and undervalued in this spot. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' +1 line provides critical cushion in what projects as a close game. Lakers have historically underperformed as slight favorites. |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Moneyline | Spurs | +350 (DraftKings) | 1 | Significant underdog value with 30-point differential between books (+350 vs +320). While OKC should win, this line overestimates the gap between these teams, offering long-shot value. |

These recommendations balance higher-probability plays with a calculated risk on one underdog that offers substantial value. I've allocated stakes based on both the statistical edge and confidence level in each selection.
