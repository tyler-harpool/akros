## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | Significant price discrepancy between bookmakers (FanDuel -190 vs DraftKings -218). Denver is historically strong at home, and this represents a 28-point better price for the same bet. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 units | Value in taking the smaller spread on DraftKings (-1) versus FanDuel (-1.5), especially in what projects to be a close game. Lakers typically perform well in high-profile post-Christmas games. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -105 | 2 units | In this virtual pick'em game, getting a point with the Spurs at a better price (-105 vs -115 for Mavs) offers value, particularly early in the season when teams are still finding their rhythm. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 227 | -112 | 3 units | Taking the lower total on DraftKings (227 vs 228.5 on FanDuel) creates value for an over bet. Christmas games historically trend higher in scoring due to the spotlight and offensive emphasis. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 units | Opportunity to play the middle by taking under 226.5 on FanDuel while DraftKings offers 225.5. This Christmas Day matchup features teams that could emphasize defensive intensity in a showcase game. |

These recommendations balance risk and reward, with higher stake units assigned to bets with clearer value propositions. The discrepancies between bookmakers create natural opportunities to find better prices for essentially the same wagers.
