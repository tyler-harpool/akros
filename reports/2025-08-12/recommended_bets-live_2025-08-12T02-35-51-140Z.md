## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 | With only a 1-point spread and slight bookmaker disagreement, this suggests a highly competitive game. The half-point difference between books creates value on the DraftKings line if the Lakers show strong ball movement but are down early due to shooting variance. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 2 | The half-point spread difference between books (2.5 vs 3) indicates uncertainty. FanDuel's lower spread offers value, especially if the Knicks face early deficit but maintain better shot quality metrics during live play. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 230.5 | -110 | 3 | The 1.5 point total discrepancy between books is significant. FanDuel's higher total creates value, particularly if early-game pace is faster than expected but defensive adjustments are visible. |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 | 4 | The 50-point moneyline difference between books (-455 vs -405) is substantial. If Spurs show early competitive play causing the Thunder live ML to drift higher than -405, there's clear value on the superior team to assert dominance in later quarters. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 2 | With a 1-point total discrepancy between books, DraftKings offers the lower number. If early defensive intensity causes a slow start, the live total may drop further, creating value on the over if both teams' offensive efficiency metrics remain strong. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as lines move rapidly in response to game events. Always confirm current odds before placing bets, as they can change significantly during gameplay.
