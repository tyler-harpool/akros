## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|----------|------|-------|----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 | Double-digit NBA spreads historically offer value to underdogs, with DraftKings providing the best available odds for this play. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 227.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | FanDuel offers the best price on the under, and without lineup data, the conservative play is to favor the under when presented with a high total. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +430 (FanDuel) | 1 | For those seeking a high-reward opportunity, FanDuel's +430 offers significantly better value than DraftKings for the same bet. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | 1H Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | First half spreads typically offer better value for underdogs, as favorites tend to pull away later in games if they do cover large spreads. |

These recommendations balance the limited information available with fundamental betting principles like line shopping and historical spread performance patterns. Given the absence of detailed team information, I've emphasized finding the best available odds while maintaining reasonable stake sizes.
