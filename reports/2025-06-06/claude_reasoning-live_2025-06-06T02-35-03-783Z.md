Let me analyze the provided information for live betting opportunities in the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game.

First, let's understand the current game state based on the odds:
- The Thunder are heavy favorites with moneyline odds of -6000 (FanDuel) and -4000 (DraftKings)
- The spread has the Thunder favored by -13.5 (FanDuel) or -14.5 (DraftKings)
- The total points line is set at 219.5 (FanDuel) or 220.5 (DraftKings)

From these odds, I can infer that:
1. The Thunder are likely winning by a substantial margin
2. The game is probably in the later stages (given the extreme moneyline odds)
3. There's still some uncertainty about the final margin (13.5-14.5 points) and total points

Since I don't have the exact current score, time remaining, or specific in-game statistics, I'll need to base my analysis on the information provided through the odds.

Let's consider some potential betting opportunities:

1. Spread Betting:
   - The Thunder are favored by 13.5-14.5 points
   - The odds (-105 to -140) suggest some uncertainty about whether they'll cover
   - If the Thunder have their starters in and are in rhythm, they could potentially extend the lead further
   - However, if they're up big, they might rest starters which could allow Indiana to narrow the gap

2. Total Points:
   - The total is set at 219.5-220.5 points
   - With a likely blowout in progress, pace could slow as benches empty
   - However, bench players often play with less defensive discipline, which could lead to more scoring

3. Alternative Lines:
   - With such a big spread, there might be value in alternative spreads
   - For the Pacers, a larger spread (e.g., +17.5 or +20.5) might offer value if the Thunder rest starters
   - For the Thunder, a smaller spread (e.g., -10.5) might offer value if they maintain intensity

Now let's consider what we know about these teams:

The Thunder:
- Led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a scoring machine
- Chet Holmgren provides rim protection and scoring versatility
- They're a strong defensive team that can extend leads through stops
- Their bench is generally solid

The Pacers:
- Led by Tyrese Haliburton, an excellent playmaker
- Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner provide scoring in the frontcourt
- They play at a fast pace and can score in bunches
- Their defense can be inconsistent

Given the limited information, here are some potential betting recommendations:

1. Pacers +14.5 (-125) at DraftKings
   - If this is a blowout, the Thunder may rest starters in the 4th quarter
   - Pacers play at a fast pace and can score quickly to narrow gaps
   - The +14.5 provides a bit more cushion than the +13.5 at FanDuel

2. Under 220.5 (-115) at DraftKings
   - If this is a blowout with bench players in, the pace may slow
   - Teams might be less efficient offensively with bench units
   - Clock will run continuously in the 4th quarter if the game is decided

3. Alternate Spread: Pacers +18.5 (odds not provided, but would likely be around -160 to -180)
   - Provides even more cushion if the Thunder rest starters
   - Could be valuable if the game is already in garbage time

4. Live Player Props: Bench players scoring overs (not provided in the data)
   - In blowouts, bench players get extended minutes
   - Could target backup scorers on both teams

Without more specific in-game information, these recommendations come with significant caveats. I'm making educated guesses based on the extreme odds and my knowledge of how NBA games typically unfold when one team has a big lead.

For my final recommendations, I'll focus on the bets that seem most reasonable given the limited information:

1. Pacers +14.5 (-125) at DraftKings
2. Under 220.5 (-115) at DraftKings
3. A cautious approach to the Pacers moneyline at +1500 (DraftKings) with a very small stake, only if there's significant time remaining and a potential comeback scenario

Let me formulate these into clear recommendations with appropriate stakes:
