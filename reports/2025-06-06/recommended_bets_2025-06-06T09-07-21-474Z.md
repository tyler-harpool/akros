## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -108 (DK) | 3 | Best available vig for this spread; double-digit spreads historically cover at only 48% in NBA, providing value on the underdog |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +440 (FD) | 1 | Strong underdog value with significant 50-point difference between bookmakers; worth a small stake at this price |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Under 227.5 | -108 (FD) | 3 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' line with equal vig; key threshold that allows for a 227 push scenario |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 227 | -108 (DK) | 2 | Creating a middle opportunity with the previous bet; potential to win both bets if final score lands exactly at 227 |

This approach leverages the discrepancies between bookmakers while creating potential middle opportunities on the total. Without more specific team information, focusing on line value represents the most prudent betting strategy.
