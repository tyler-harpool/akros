## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +430 | 1 unit | Best underdog value between books with 10% better payout than DraftKings. Small stake justified on +430 longshot. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -108 | 3 units | Market consensus on spread but better juice at DraftKings. Double-digit NBA spreads historically favor underdogs. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 227.5 | -106 | 2 units | Best under price at FanDuel (-106 vs -110). Without lineup data, slight edge to unders as the more conservative play. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -11 | -108 | 1 unit | If splitting action, FanDuel offers best price on Thunder covering. Small hedge against Pacers spread bet. |

The primary recommendation is Pacers +11 points as our strongest play, offering the best combination of market value and historical NBA betting patterns for double-digit spreads.
