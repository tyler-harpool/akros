## Friday, June 6, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +14.5 | -125 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: The extra point of cushion compared to FanDuel's line creates immediate value. Thunder likely to rest key players if lead remains substantial. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 220.5 | -115 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Game pace typically slows with bench players, and clock runs continuously in decided games. Thunder defense should contain Pacers' scoring. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Pacers +13.5 | -140 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: While offering less cushion than DK's line, the -140 odds represent value if Thunder starters see reduced minutes down the stretch. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +1500 | 1 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Small-stake lottery ticket. Pacers' uptempo style can produce quick scoring runs to potentially make a game competitive again. |

Remember that live betting markets move extremely quickly, so confirm odds before placing any bets. The recommendations above are based on the current game state as implied by the provided odds.
