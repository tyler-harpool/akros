Let's analyze the live in-game betting situation for the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game. This appears to be a game that's already in progress, and I need to provide betting recommendations based on the current state of the game.

First, I'll summarize what we know from the information provided:

1. The game is between Oklahoma City Thunder (home) and Indiana Pacers (away)
2. The current betting lines show:
   - Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-520 to -590)
   - Spread: Thunder -11 points
   - Total: 227-227.5 points

3. The starting lineups are confirmed:
   - Pacers: Haliburton, Nembhard, Nesmith, Siakam, Turner
   - Thunder: Gilgeous-Alexander, Wallace, Dort, Williams, Holmgren

What's notably missing from the provided information:
- The current score, time remaining, and quarter
- Recent performance trends during this game
- Player stats so far in the game
- Any live/in-game betting lines beyond the main markets
- Information about injuries that might be affecting the game

Without this crucial information about the current game state, it's challenging to make highly specific live betting recommendations. However, I can make some inferences based on the betting lines.

The -11 spread suggests that the Thunder are significantly ahead in the game or were heavily favored before the game started. The high total of 227-227.5 suggests this is expected to be a relatively high-scoring game, which aligns with both teams' playing styles - the Pacers are known for their fast pace, while the Thunder have a strong offense led by SGA.

Given the limitations of the information provided, I'll focus on analyzing the teams' strengths, matchups, and providing bet recommendations that would be reasonable regardless of the exact current game state:

Team Analysis:

1. Oklahoma City Thunder:
- Led by superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
- Chet Holmgren provides elite rim protection
- Strong defensive team with Dort as a premier perimeter defender
- Efficient offense that can score in multiple ways
- Home court advantage

2. Indiana Pacers:
- Tyrese Haliburton orchestrates one of the fastest offenses in the league
- Pascal Siakam provides versatile scoring
- Myles Turner offers floor spacing and rim protection
- Generally stronger on offense than defense
- Known for high-tempo play and scoring runs

Matchup Considerations:
- The Thunder's defense may be able to slow down the Pacers' typically fast pace
- Dort might be assigned to limit Haliburton's effectiveness
- The Holmgren vs. Turner matchup features two of the better stretch-5s in the league
- The Thunder have the edge in overall talent with SGA

Without knowing the current game state, I'll provide bet recommendations that consider different plausible scenarios:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. If the Thunder are leading substantially (which the -11 spread suggests):
   I might recommend the Pacers to cover a large live spread, as NBA games often feature comeback attempts and garbage time scoring that can narrow margins.

2. If the pace has been slower than expected:
   I might recommend an under on the live total, especially if defensive adjustments are being made.

3. If star players are performing well:
   I might recommend player prop overs for those with momentum.

4. If the game is relatively close:
   I might recommend the Thunder to cover a smaller live spread given their home court advantage and talent edge.

Since I don't have the exact live lines, I'll use the pre-game lines provided as a basis for my recommendations, but note that these would be adjusted based on the current game state in a real scenario.
