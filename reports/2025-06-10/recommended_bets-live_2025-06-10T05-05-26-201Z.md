## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Live Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -108 | 3 | If Pacers are shooting above their season average early, expect regression as Thunder's elite defense adjusts |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Live Total | Under 228.5 | -112 | 2 | Value appears if scoring pace is high early but Thunder begin controlling tempo in half-court sets |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Live ML | Pacers | 180 | 1 | If Thunder build early lead but Pacers show shooting efficiency, comeback potential creates value at this price |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Live Quarter Spread | Pacers +1.5 4Q | -110* | 2 | Thunder have shown tendency to play conservatively with leads; Pacers typically fight until final buzzer |

*Note: Quarter spread odds estimated based on typical market pricing

For more precise live betting recommendations, I would need current game state information including score, time remaining, and actual live odds.
