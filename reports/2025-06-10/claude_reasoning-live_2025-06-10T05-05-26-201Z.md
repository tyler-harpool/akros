I'm being asked to analyze live in-game NBA betting opportunities for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game taking place on June 12, 2025. Let me break down what I have and what I'm missing:

WHAT I HAVE:
- Pre-game betting lines (moneyline, spread, totals) from DraftKings and FanDuel
- The game date and start time

WHAT I'M MISSING:
- CURRENT game state (score, time remaining, quarter, etc.)
- Live betting odds
- Starting lineups
- Injury information
- Any recent game events or momentum shifts
- Current player performance stats from the game

This is a significant limitation because I'm supposed to be analyzing LIVE in-game betting opportunities, but I don't have any information about the current state of the game. Without knowing the current score, time remaining, which players are performing well/poorly, and what the live betting lines are, it's impossible to make informed in-game betting recommendations.

Given these constraints, I'll structure my response to acknowledge these limitations while providing some general guidance on what factors would be important to consider for live betting on this matchup, and then make some very general recommendations with appropriate caveats.

Key factors I would normally consider for live NBA betting:

1. Current score and time remaining (point differential relative to spread)
2. Pace of play compared to pre-game expectations
3. Foul trouble for key players
4. Shooting performance vs. expected averages (regression to mean opportunities)
5. Lineup combinations currently on the floor
6. Momentum shifts and runs
7. Tactical adjustments made by coaches
8. Live betting lines and how they compare to pre-game expectations

Since I don't have specific live information, my recommended bets will need to be more general and somewhat hypothetical based on certain game scenarios that might be occurring.
