## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -112 (DK) | 3 | The half-point hook provides crucial insurance in what could be a competitive game. Pacers' home court advantage typically keeps games closer than road matchups. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +180 | 1 | While Thunder are rightful favorites, this represents value at +180 for a home team with upset potential based on their offensive capabilities. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 (FD) | 3 | Thunder's defensive discipline should slow the pace compared to typical Pacers games. The extra half-point on FanDuel provides additional value. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5 | -114 (FD) | 2 | If Thunder win, they likely do so by margin. The -5 at FanDuel offers better protection than -5.5 at DraftKings. |

These recommendations are based on odds analysis and general team profiles. Monitoring lineup announcements and injury reports before placing bets would be advisable.
