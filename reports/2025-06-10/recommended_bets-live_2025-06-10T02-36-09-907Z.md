## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5 | -106 | 3 units | Better value than the +5.5 (-112) at DraftKings if you believe margin will be tight; FanDuel offering better price on this key number |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -108 | 2 units | If Thunder are showing dominance in the flow of play, getting -5.5 at this price is better than -5 (-114) at FanDuel |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -112 | 3 units | Defensive intensity typically increases as games progress; DraftKings offering slightly better value than FanDuel |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +180 | 1 unit | Strong underdog value if Pacers are keeping it competitive; maximum value play if they're showing momentum |

These recommendations assume you're watching the game and can judge momentum, performance trends, and coaching adjustments in real-time. Adjust stakes based on what you're seeing on the court, especially shooting performance and defensive intensity.
