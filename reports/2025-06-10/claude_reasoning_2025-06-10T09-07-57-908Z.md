Let me analyze the betting opportunity between the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for Tuesday, June 10, 2025.

First, let's summarize the information I have:

1. Game: Indiana Pacers (home) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (away)
2. Date/Time: June 12, 2025, 12:35:00 AM

Betting odds:
- Moneyline: 
  - Pacers: +180 (both DraftKings and FanDuel)
  - Thunder: -218 (DraftKings) / -215 (FanDuel)
- Spread:
  - Pacers: +5.5 (-112) DK / +5 (-106) FD
  - Thunder: -5.5 (-108) DK / -5 (-114) FD
- Totals:
  - DraftKings: 228 (O/U both -110)
  - FanDuel: 228.5 (O/U both -110)

Other information:
- No lineup data is available for either team
- No injury information is provided
- No statistical edges were detected in the betting markets

This is a limited information scenario, but I'll analyze the situation based on the odds and general knowledge about these teams.

The odds suggest that Oklahoma City Thunder are considerable favorites in this matchup. Converting moneyline odds:
- Thunder at -218: 68.6% implied probability of winning
- Thunder at -215: 68.3% implied probability of winning
- Pacers at +180: 35.7% implied probability of winning

The spread of 5 to 5.5 points favoring the Thunder also indicates they're expected to win by a moderate margin.

Without specific lineup and injury information, I need to consider general team profiles and recent performance trends:

Oklahoma City Thunder:
- Generally known as a young, dynamic team led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
- Strong defensive identity under coach Mark Daigneault
- Historically has played at a controlled pace

Indiana Pacers:
- Typically play at a faster pace under Rick Carlisle
- Known for offensive efficiency but sometimes struggle defensively
- Home court advantage at Gainbridge Fieldhouse

The total points line of 228-228.5 suggests oddsmakers expect a relatively high-scoring game, which aligns with the Pacers' typical style of play, though somewhat high for a Thunder game.

Let's look for potential betting value:

1. Spread differences: There's a half-point difference between DraftKings (-5.5) and FanDuel (-5) for the Thunder spread. This presents a potential middle opportunity if you believe the game will land exactly on a 5-point Thunder victory.

2. Totals: The slight 0.5 point difference between sportsbooks on the total (228 vs 228.5) suggests some uncertainty about the pace/scoring of this game.

3. Moneyline: The Thunder's moneyline is slightly better on FanDuel (-215 vs -218), while the Pacers' moneyline is the same (+180) at both books.

Without more specific information about lineups, injuries, or recent form, my analysis is somewhat limited. However, I can make some educated recommendations based on the odds structure and general team profiles.

Recommendations:

1. If you believe the Thunder will win by exactly 5 points: Bet Thunder -5 on FanDuel and Pacers +5.5 on DraftKings for a middle opportunity.

2. If you believe in the Thunder's overall superiority: Their moneyline at -215 on FanDuel is slightly better than DraftKings.

3. For totals bettors: If you lean toward the over, take Over 228 on DraftKings rather than Over 228.5 on FanDuel. If you like the under, take Under 228.5 on FanDuel rather than Under 228 on DraftKings.

4. The Pacers as home underdogs at +180 might represent value if you believe they'll outperform expectations.

Let me create a formal recommendations table based on this analysis:
