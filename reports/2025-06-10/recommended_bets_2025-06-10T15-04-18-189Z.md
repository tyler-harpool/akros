## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 3 units | The extra half-point over FanDuel's line provides crucial protection. NBA home underdogs historically outperform market expectations, especially when receiving 5+ points. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | We're getting the higher total number compared to DraftKings' 228. Without specific team tempo data, securing the extra half-point provides mathematical edge. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +180 (DraftKings/FanDuel) | 1 unit | If the spread accurately reflects a competitive game within 5-6 points, the +180 price implies value. Home court advantage (typically worth 2-3 points) suggests the true line should be closer to +160. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | The lower spread number compared to DraftKings (-5.5) provides better value when backing the road favorite. The slight juice increase (-114 vs -108) is worth paying for the improved number. |

Remember that without current lineup and injury information, these recommendations primarily focus on securing mathematical advantages through superior line positioning. Adjust stakes accordingly if additional team information becomes available before tipoff.
