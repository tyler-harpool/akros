Let me analyze the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for June 12, 2025. I need to provide a thorough betting analysis and make 3-5 specific bet recommendations.

First, let's organize what we know:

## Game Information
- Indiana Pacers (home) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (away)
- Date: June 12, 2025
- Time: 12:35:00 AM

## Betting Lines

### Moneyline
- Indiana (Home): +180 (DraftKings), +184 (FanDuel)
- OKC (Away): -218 (DraftKings), -220 (FanDuel)

### Spread
- Indiana +5.5: -112 (DraftKings), -114 (FanDuel)
- OKC -5.5: -108 (DraftKings), -106 (FanDuel)

### Totals
- 228.5 points: -110 for both Over and Under at both books

## Additional Information
- No lineup data is available for either team
- No injury information provided
- No statistical edges were detected in the current betting markets

Given the limited information, I'll need to analyze this game based on the betting lines themselves, implied probabilities, and what these lines tell us about market expectations.

### Analysis of Betting Lines

1. **Moneyline Analysis**:
   - OKC's moneyline of -218 to -220 implies about a 68-69% chance of winning
   - Indiana's moneyline of +180 to +184 implies about a 35-36% chance of winning
   - The combined implied probability exceeds 100% (around 104%), which represents the bookmaker's margin

2. **Spread Analysis**:
   - OKC is favored by 5.5 points, which is a significant but not overwhelming favorite
   - The juice is slightly better on DraftKings for Indiana (+5.5 at -112) compared to FanDuel (-114)
   - The juice is slightly better on FanDuel for OKC (-5.5 at -106) compared to DraftKings (-108)

3. **Totals Analysis**:
   - The total is set at 228.5 points with standard -110 juice on both sides at both books
   - This suggests an expectation of a relatively high-scoring game

### Context Interpretation

Without specific lineup, injury, or statistical edge information, we can make some inferences:

- The 5.5-point spread suggests OKC is the better team but not overwhelmingly so
- The relatively high total of 228.5 suggests both teams have good offenses and/or weaker defenses
- The home-court advantage doesn't seem to be swinging the line much in Indiana's favor
- The consistency of the lines across bookmakers suggests the market is relatively efficient

### Potential Betting Approaches

1. **Look for Small Edges in the Lines**:
   - FanDuel offers slightly better value on Indiana's moneyline (+184 vs +180)
   - FanDuel offers slightly better value on OKC's spread (-5.5 at -106 vs -108)
   - Both books offer the same value on totals

2. **Consider Game Dynamics**:
   - Without lineup information, we need to rely on what the lines tell us
   - The 5.5 point spread suggests a competitive game but with a clear favorite
   - The high total suggests offensive production from both teams

Let me develop my betting recommendations based on this analysis:

### Potential Recommendations:

1. **OKC -5.5 (-106) at FanDuel**:
   - This offers slightly better value than DraftKings
   - The spread is significant but not excessive
   - Rationale: If OKC is indeed the better team as the lines suggest, they should be able to cover this spread

2. **Indiana Pacers Moneyline (+184) at FanDuel**:
   - This offers the best potential return if looking for an underdog play
   - Rationale: Home underdogs sometimes present value, and +184 implies only a 35% win probability

3. **Over 228.5 (-110)**:
   - The high total suggests both teams can score
   - Rationale: If both teams have strong offenses as the total suggests, this could be a high-scoring affair

4. **Indiana +5.5 (-112) at DraftKings**:
   - This offers slightly better value than FanDuel
   - Rationale: Home teams tend to keep games closer, making the spread potentially valuable

5. **Under 228.5 (-110)**:
   - Rationale: High totals sometimes present value on the under, especially if the game pace slows down in the second half

Now let me evaluate my confidence in each of these potential recommendations to assign stakes:

1. **OKC -5.5 (-106) at FanDuel**: Medium confidence (3 units)
   - The spread is reasonable and the juice is favorable
   - OKC being a clear favorite suggests they should win by margin

2. **Indiana Pacers Moneyline (+184) at FanDuel**: Low confidence (1 unit)
   - This is a value play on an underdog, but the odds reflect the lower probability

3. **Over 228.5 (-110)**: Medium-low confidence (2 units)
   - Without team stats, it's hard to have high confidence in totals

4. **Indiana +5.5 (-112) at DraftKings**: Medium confidence (3 units)
   - Home underdogs with points can be valuable

5. **Under 228.5 (-110)**: Low confidence (1 unit)
   - Without team pace and defensive metrics, this is speculative

I'll select the 3-5 bets I have the most confidence in for my final recommendations.

Final Selections:
1. OKC -5.5 (-106) at FanDuel - 3 units
2. Indiana +5.5 (-112) at DraftKings - 3 units
3. Over 228.5 (-110) - 2 units
4. Indiana Moneyline (+184) at FanDuel - 1 unit

Wait, I noticed an issue - I've recommended both OKC -5.5 and Indiana +5.5, which is contradictory. I should choose one direction on the spread. Given the information available, I'll lean toward the favorite covering since they're the favorite for a reason.

Revised Final Selections:
1. OKC -5.5 (-106) at FanDuel - 3 units
2. Over 228.5 (-110) - 2 units
3. Indiana Moneyline (+184) at FanDuel - 1 unit

I should add one more reasonably confident bet to make sure I have at least 3 solid recommendations. I'll add a small play on the Under as a hedge against the Over, given the high total:

4. Under 228.5 (-110) - 1 unit

Now I'll format these into a proper recommendation table for my final answer.
