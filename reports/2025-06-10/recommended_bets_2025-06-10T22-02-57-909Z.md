## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | FanDuel offers the best value on this line, and the Thunder's status as a clear road favorite suggests they're the significantly better team. The -106 juice provides better value than typical -110 lines. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 228.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | The high total suggests both teams have potent offenses. Without defensive metrics suggesting otherwise, this projected high-scoring affair should clear the total. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +184 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Small value play on the home underdog. At +184, we only need Indiana to win approximately 35% of the time to break even, which provides a small edge considering home court advantage. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Game Prop | First Half Over 114.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 1 unit | Teams with strong offenses typically start faster, and this derived play (assuming a first half line of 114.5) offers value in a projected high-scoring game. |

Remember that all sports betting carries inherent risk, and these recommendations are based on the limited information available. Consider your own risk tolerance and bankroll management when placing wagers.
