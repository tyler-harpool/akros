Let's analyze these games further:

### Knicks vs Pacers Analysis:

**Context/Market Consensus:**
- The Knicks are clear favorites at home, with implied probabilities between 70-72% based on the moneyline odds.
- The line is pretty consistent across books, with a 6-6.5 point spread favoring New York.
- Total points line is 224.5 across all books, suggesting an expectation of a moderately high-scoring game.

**Key Considerations:**
- No lineup information is available, which makes detailed analysis more challenging.
- No injury information is provided.
- The uniform total across all books suggests market consensus on the expected scoring.
- BetMGM offers a slightly better line for Pacers bettors at +6.5 vs the +6 at other books.

**Potential Edges:**
- The FanDuel Pacers moneyline at +215 offers the best value if backing the underdog.
- For Knicks backers, DraftKings offers the best moneyline value at -238.

### Timberwolves vs Thunder Analysis:

**Context/Market Consensus:**
- The Thunder are favored on the road, with implied probabilities between 57-59%.
- The spread is consistently 2.5 points across all books.
- There's a small discrepancy in the totals line: FanDuel has 218.5 while the others have 217.5.

**Key Considerations:**
- No lineup information is available.
- No injury information is provided.
- Thunder being favored on the road suggests they're perceived as the stronger team.
- The 1-point difference in the totals line between FanDuel and other books creates a potential middle opportunity.

**Potential Edges:**
- DraftKings offers the best value for Timberwolves moneyline backers at +114.
- DraftKings also offers the best value for Thunder moneyline bettors at -135.
- BetMGM offers the best vig for Timberwolves spread bettors at +2.5 (-105).
- FanDuel's higher total (218.5) creates value on the Under if you believe the true total is closer to 217.5.
- Conversely, BetMGM's Under 217.5 at -105 offers good value if you believe scoring will be lower.

Let me now formulate some specific betting recommendations based on this analysis:

## Recommended Bets:

1. **Thunder ML on DraftKings (-135)**:
   - This offers the best price on the Thunder who are favored despite being on the road.
   - The 3-5 point difference in odds compared to other books provides slight value.
   - Without injury information, I'll assign a moderate stake of 3 units.

2. **Pacers +6.5 on BetMGM (-110)**:
   - The extra half-point compared to other books is valuable in what could be a competitive game.
   - Getting this key number at standard juice makes it worth considering.
   - I'll assign 2 units due to moderate confidence.

3. **Under 218.5 points on FanDuel (-110)**:
   - The one-point higher total compared to other books creates value.
   - If the consensus total is 217.5 at other books, this gives us additional cushion.
   - I'll assign 3 units given the clear discrepancy.

4. **Timberwolves ML on DraftKings (+114)**:
   - Best odds for the home underdog, which represents value if you believe Minnesota has a stronger chance than the market suggests.
   - Home court advantage could be undervalued here.
   - I'll assign 2 units given it's an underdog play.

5. **Under 217.5 on BetMGM (-105)**:
   - The most favorable odds for the Under compared to other books.
   - If the game is expected to be defensive-minded, this offers value.
   - I'll assign 2 units with modest confidence.

These recommendations try to exploit the small differences between sportsbooks and identify potential value. However, the limited information on lineups and injuries makes it challenging to have extremely high confidence in any specific bet.
