## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6 | -110 | 3 | Six points provides substantial cushion in what could be a competitive game. Without lineup information, taking the points with the underdog offers safety. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | -108 | 3 | High totals often present value on the under, especially with the slightly better -108 odds. If defensive intensity increases, this total could be difficult to reach. |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Spread | Timberwolves +2.5 | -108 | 4 | Home underdogs with a tight spread offer consistent value in the NBA. The -108 odds at DraftKings provide slightly better value than competitors. |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers both a half-point advantage and better odds (-105) compared to other bookmakers, creating a compelling opportunity on the under. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Thunder | -142 | 2 | The Thunder being road favorites suggests they're the superior team. While not offering tremendous value, the implied 59% win probability could be underestimating Oklahoma City's chances. |

Without specific lineup and injury information, these recommendations balance risk and potential reward while leveraging the small advantages identified across different bookmakers.
