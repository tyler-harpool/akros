## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -135 (DraftKings) | 3 | Best price available on Thunder by 9-10 points compared to other books. Road favorite status suggests strong team that's undervalued at this price point. |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Total | Under 218.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 | One point higher than consensus 217.5 at other books creates value with additional cushion. Strong middle opportunity if game lands between 217-218 points. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 | Half-point advantage over other books provides critical hook on key number. Creates stronger position against a potential 6-point Knicks win. |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Most favorable odds for this total with reduced juice compared to competitors. Strong value if game trends defensive as playoff-caliber teams often do. |
| Timberwolves vs Thunder | Moneyline | Timberwolves | +114 (DraftKings) | 1 | Best underdog price available, offering value on home team that may be underestimated. Home court advantage could be significant factor not fully accounted for in this line. |

These recommendations focus on exploiting pricing inefficiencies between sportsbooks while balancing risk appropriately through stake sizing. The strongest values appear to be in the Thunder/Timberwolves game where there are notable discrepancies in both moneyline and totals markets.
