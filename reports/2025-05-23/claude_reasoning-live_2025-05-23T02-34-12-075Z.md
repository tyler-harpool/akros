Let me analyze the provided betting opportunities, focusing on the games in progress and upcoming games.

## Thunder vs Timberwolves (Live Game)

From the information provided, this game is currently in progress. Let's analyze what the odds tell us about the current state of the game:

1. **Moneyline Odds**:
   - Oklahoma City is heavily favored with moneyline odds ranging from -3000 to -5000
   - Minnesota has odds of +1000 to +1400
   - This suggests OKC has a commanding lead in the game

2. **Spread Odds**:
   - OKC is favored by 13.5 to 15.5 points
   - This confirms they have a significant lead in the game
   - The variation between bookmakers (13.5 vs 15.5) suggests some disagreement on how the rest of the game will play out

3. **Totals**:
   - The total points line is set between 216.5 and 218.5
   - This can help us infer what portion of the game has been played and what pace is expected for the remainder

Since this is a live game, the large spread and heavily lopsided moneyline suggest that OKC has built a substantial lead. Without knowing the exact score, quarter, or time remaining, it's harder to make precise recommendations, but we can still identify potential value.

Given the extreme moneyline odds, there's likely little value there unless we believe Minnesota has a realistic comeback chance. The spread of 13.5-15.5 indicates bookmakers expect OKC to maintain or slightly expand their lead.

For totals, the relatively tight range (216.5-218.5) suggests the game has been fairly well-paced, and there's some consensus on how many more points will be scored.

## Knicks vs Pacers (Upcoming Game)

This game hasn't started yet, so we're dealing with pre-game odds:

1. **Moneyline Odds**:
   - New York is favored at home with odds around -250 to -258
   - Indiana is the underdog at +200 to +210

2. **Spread Odds**:
   - New York is favored by 6 to 6.5 points
   - The line is fairly consistent across bookmakers

3. **Totals**:
   - The total points line is set between 225.5 and 226
   - This suggests an expected high-scoring game

Now let's think about potential live betting opportunities based on the information available:

## Thunder vs Timberwolves (Live Game)

Without knowing the exact game state (score, time remaining, etc.), I'll need to make some inferences:

1. **Timberwolves Comeback Potential**:
   - Given the large spread, Minnesota is clearly trailing significantly
   - If they've shown flashes of competitiveness, the +13.5 spread might have value
   - However, if OKC is dominating all aspects, there may be value in OKC -13.5
   
2. **Game Pace and Totals**:
   - If the game has been high-scoring and up-tempo, the over might have value
   - If defense has tightened or the pace has slowed, the under could be valuable
   - FanDuel offers the lowest total at 216.5, which might be worth considering for the over if the pace has been quick

3. **Player Props** (though not provided in the data):
   - In blowout scenarios, star players might play fewer minutes
   - This could affect the performance of players like SGA, Edwards, and others

## Knicks vs Pacers (Upcoming Game)

Since this game hasn't started yet, we'd typically analyze pre-game factors. However, since we're focusing on live betting, I'll hold off on specific recommendations until the game is in progress.

For now, I'll note that the 6-6.5 point spread and -250 moneyline indicate New York is a solid favorite, while the high total of 225.5-226 suggests an expected fast-paced, high-scoring affair.

## Bet Recommendations for Thunder vs Timberwolves (Live)

Without knowing the exact game state, here are potential value bets based on the odds provided:

1. **Timberwolves +13.5 (DraftKings/BetMGM at -120/-125)**:
   - If Minnesota has shown any signs of life and the game isn't completely out of reach
   - If OKC's lead is around 10-15 points, taking the +13.5 provides a buffer

2. **Over 216.5 points (FanDuel at -120)**:
   - If the pace has been quick and scoring has been consistent
   - This is the lowest total available across bookmakers

3. **Under 218.5 points (DraftKings/BetMGM at -120/-118)**:
   - If the game has slowed down or if we expect bench players to get extended minutes in a blowout
   - If the teams are struggling offensively

Given the limited information about the current game state, these recommendations are speculative. In a real live betting scenario, I would want to know the current score, time remaining, pace statistics, and recent performance to make more precise recommendations.

Since I don't have exact current game information, I'll provide recommendations with some conditional reasoning that would make them valuable plays. This way, if the conditions align with the actual game state, these bets would represent good value.

Let me prepare the RECOMMENDED BETS section with 3-5 concrete bet recommendations based on the analysis above:

For Thunder vs Timberwolves, I'll include a spread bet, a totals bet, and possibly a conditional moneyline bet if there's value.

For the upcoming Knicks vs Pacers game, I'll focus on pre-game value that might be available before tip-off, though this isn't technically "live" betting yet.
