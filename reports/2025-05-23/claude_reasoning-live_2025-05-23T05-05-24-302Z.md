Let me analyze the provided information and identify potential live betting opportunities for the NBA games. I need to be careful since this is live in-game betting, and markets move quickly.

First, let's clarify what information I have and what might be missing:

1. I have basic betting lines (moneyline, spread, totals) for two games:
   - New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers
   - Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder

2. I don't have:
   - Current game scores or time remaining
   - Recent game flow or momentum information
   - Player performance in the current game
   - Current lineups on the floor
   - Foul trouble information
   - Team shooting percentages in the current game
   - Pace of play in the current game

This makes live in-game analysis challenging. I'll have to base my analysis primarily on the betting lines themselves and any inferences I can make from them.

Let's analyze each game based on the available information:

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

The Knicks are heavy favorites at home with moneyline odds between -250 and -258, and they're favored by 6 to 6.5 points on the spread. The total is set at 225.5-226 points.

Key observations:
- The odds suggest this is a home game for the Knicks (since they're the favorite)
- The 6-point spread indicates a moderate advantage for the Knicks
- The relatively high total (225.5-226) suggests an expectation of a high-scoring game
- There's a small discrepancy in the spread across books (6 vs 6.5), which might create some arbitrage opportunities

Without knowing the current score or game situation, it's hard to make specific recommendations. However, based on the lines, I can infer that the Knicks are expected to win by a moderate margin in a high-scoring game.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder are favored despite playing on the road, with moneyline odds between -150 and -164. The spread is 3.5 points in favor of OKC, and the total is set at 217.5-218 points.

Key observations:
- The Thunder are road favorites (since Minnesota is listed as "Home Team" but has plus odds)
- A 3.5-point spread suggests a relatively close game is expected
- The total is moderately high but not extreme
- BetMGM offers the best value for a Thunder moneyline bet at -150

Again, without current game information, it's challenging to make specific in-game recommendations.

Based on the limited information available, here are potential betting opportunities:

1. For the Knicks vs Pacers game:
   - BetMGM offers the best value for a Knicks spread bet at -6.5 (-102)
   - DraftKings offers the best value for an Under bet at 225.5 (-108)

2. For the Timberwolves vs Thunder game:
   - BetMGM offers the best value for a Thunder moneyline bet at -150
   - BetMGM also offers the best value for a Thunder spread bet at -3.5 (-105)
   - BetMGM offers the best value for an Under bet at 217.5 (-105)

However, since this is live in-game betting, I would typically need to know the current game state to make more informed recommendations. For example:
- If the Knicks are currently trailing but showing signs of a comeback, their moneyline might be valuable
- If the Thunder are shooting unusually poorly but are still in the game, they might cover the spread when their shooting regresses to the mean
- If the pace is much slower or faster than expected, that would affect the total bets

Without this information, I'll need to be more conservative in my recommendations and focus on the odds discrepancies and fundamental matchup factors.

Let me create 3-5 recommended bets based on the available information:

1. Thunder Moneyline at -150 (BetMGM): This offers the best value among the books, and the Thunder are road favorites, suggesting they're the stronger team.

2. Knicks -6.5 at -102 (BetMGM): This offers good value for a spread bet, especially if the Knicks are playing well at home.

3. Timberwolves vs Thunder Under 217.5 at -105 (BetMGM): BetMGM offers the best odds for the under, and playoff games (assuming these are playoff games) often see tighter defense.

4. Knicks vs Pacers Over 226 at -110 (FanDuel): If this is a fast-paced game with good shooting, the over could hit.

5. Pacers +6.5 at -118 (BetMGM): If the Pacers are keeping it close or the Knicks are struggling, this spread could be valuable.

Let me summarize these in a properly formatted recommendation table:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Minnesota vs OKC | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 | 3 | Best value across books for Thunder, who are road favorites |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 | 2 | Good value for spread bet if Knicks performing well at home |
| Minnesota vs OKC | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 2 | Best odds for under, playoff games often have tighter defense |
| NY vs Indiana | Total | Over 226 | -110 | 1 | Value if game pace is fast with good shooting |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -118 | 1 | Value if Pacers keeping it close or Knicks struggling |

Wait, I notice a mistake in my analysis. I initially interpreted the tables as listing the home team first, but the column headers actually specify which team is home and away. Let me correct my understanding:

- For NY vs Indiana: New York is hosting (home team) and is the favorite (-258 moneyline, -6 spread)
- For Minnesota vs OKC: Minnesota is hosting (home team) but is the underdog (+138 moneyline, +3.5 spread)

This confirms my initial analysis, but I wanted to make sure I understood the data format correctly.

Also, I just realized that the prompt mentions this is LIVE in-game betting analysis, but doesn't provide current game scores or situations. This makes it challenging to provide specific in-game recommendations. Without knowing the current game state, I'll have to focus on the pre-game odds and make more general recommendations.

Given these constraints, I'll update my recommendations to be more general and account for possible live betting scenarios:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Minnesota vs OKC | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 | 3 | Best value for Thunder across books, road favorite suggests strength |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 | 2 | Good odds for Knicks covering at home |
| Minnesota vs OKC | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 2 | Value bet if game pace is slower than expected |
| NY vs Indiana | Total | Over 226 | -110 | 1 | Value if scoring pace is high or teams shooting well |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -118 | 1 | Hedge bet if Knicks underperforming expectations |

Since this is live betting, I'd typically adjust these recommendations based on:
1. Current score
2. Time remaining
3. Which players are on the floor
4. Foul trouble
5. Shooting performance so far
6. Pace of play

Without that information, these recommendations should be considered more general and would need to be adjusted based on the actual game situations.

Wait, I'm now realizing the oddity here - the prompt says these are live in-game betting opportunities, but the games are scheduled for May 24 and May 25, 2025, which are future dates (we're in 2023). This seems to be hypothetical future games. 

Given the confusion, I'll proceed with my recommendations based on the information provided, but I'll adjust my reasoning to account for the limited information available.

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Minnesota vs OKC | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best odds available across books for the road favorite |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 2 | Value in the odds compared to -6 at other books |
| Minnesota vs OKC | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | BetMGM offers the best odds for this under bet |
| NY vs Indiana | Total | Under 225.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Best odds available for the under in this game |
| NY vs Indiana | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 (DraftKings/FanDuel) | 1 | Small value bet on underdog with best available odds |

I've added the specific bookmaker in the odds column for clarity. These recommendations are based on the best available odds across the different bookmakers, but without current game information, they should be considered with caution.

Let me revise the explanation for these bets to make them more suitable for live betting scenarios, assuming these are indeed live games in progress:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Minnesota vs OKC | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 (BetMGM) | 3 | Thunder as road favorites with the best odds available; value increases if they're currently trailing or in a close game |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 2 | Excellent odds for Knicks spread; valuable if NY showing offensive rhythm and defensive intensity |
| Minnesota vs OKC | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Value bet if defensive intensity is high and pace is slower than expected |
| NY vs Indiana | Total | Under 225.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Value increases if shooting percentages are below average and pace is controlled |
| NY vs Indiana | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 (DraftKings/FanDuel) | 1 | Small stake value bet if Pacers showing signs of competitiveness or Knicks struggling |

These recommendations attempt to account for potential live game scenarios, but would be much more precise with actual in-game information.

Given the context of the prompt and the future dates, I believe this is a hypothetical scenario asking for analysis of these games as if they were currently in progress. I'll adjust my final recommendations to reflect this understanding:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Minnesota vs OKC | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best value for road favorite; ideal bet if game is close or Thunder trailing slightly |
| NY vs Indiana | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 2 | Strong value if Knicks showing offensive rhythm and home court advantage |
| Minnesota vs OKC | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Value increases if defensive intensity high and scoring pace below projections |
| NY vs Indiana | Total | Under 225.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Best odds for the under; valuable if game pace slower than expected |
| NY vs Indiana | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 (DraftKings/FanDuel) | 1 | Small value bet if Pacers showing competitive edge despite underdog status |

This should provide a framework for live betting recommendations that takes into account the limitations of the information provided.
