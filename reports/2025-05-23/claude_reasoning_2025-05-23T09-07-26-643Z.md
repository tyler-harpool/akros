I need to analyze the NBA betting opportunities for the upcoming games between the New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers and Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder. Let me start by organizing the available information and then provide my analysis.

## Analyzing New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

First, let's look at the betting lines:

### Moneyline:
- Knicks (Home): -258 (DraftKings), -255 (FanDuel), -250 (BetMGM)
- Pacers (Away): 210 (DraftKings), 210 (FanDuel), 200 (BetMGM)

The Knicks are clear favorites at home, with implied probabilities around 71-72%.

### Spread:
- Knicks: -6 (-110) at DraftKings, -6 (-112) at FanDuel, -6.5 (-102) at BetMGM
- Pacers: +6 (-110) at DraftKings, +6 (-108) at FanDuel, +6.5 (-118) at BetMGM

The consensus is around Knicks -6, with BetMGM offering a slightly higher spread at -6.5 but with better odds.

### Totals:
- DraftKings: 225.5 (Over -112, Under -108)
- FanDuel: 226 (Over -110, Under -110)
- BetMGM: 225.5 (Over -110, Under -110)

The total is set at around 225.5-226 points, suggesting oddsmakers expect a relatively high-scoring game.

Unfortunately, I don't have lineup information or recent team form for this matchup, which significantly limits my ability to do a deep analysis. Without knowing if key players are injured or how these teams have been performing recently, I need to rely on the market assessment and look for any potential discrepancies between bookmakers.

## Analyzing Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder

### Moneyline:
- Timberwolves (Home): 138 (FanDuel), 136 (DraftKings), 125 (BetMGM)
- Thunder (Away): -164 (FanDuel), -162 (DraftKings), -150 (BetMGM)

The Thunder are favored on the road, with implied probabilities of around 60-62%.

### Spread:
- Timberwolves: +3.5 (-110) at FanDuel, +3.5 (-110) at DraftKings, +3.5 (-115) at BetMGM
- Thunder: -3.5 (-110) at FanDuel, -3.5 (-110) at DraftKings, -3.5 (-105) at BetMGM

The spread is consistently set at 3.5 points across all bookmakers.

### Totals:
- FanDuel: 218 (Over -110, Under -110)
- DraftKings: 217.5 (Over -112, Under -108)
- BetMGM: 217.5 (Over -115, Under -105)

The total is set at around 217.5-218 points.

Again, without lineup information or recent team form, my analysis is limited to comparing the betting markets.

## Finding Potential Value

Given the limited information available, I'll look for potential value by:
1. Comparing odds across bookmakers
2. Looking for any notable discrepancies in the lines
3. Considering general NBA trends (like home court advantage, playoff dynamics, etc.)

### Knicks vs Pacers Value Opportunities:

1. **Moneyline:** BetMGM offers the best value for the Knicks at -250 (compared to -258 at DraftKings). If betting on the favorite, this is the best option.

2. **Spread:** BetMGM offers Knicks -6.5 at -102, which is better odds than the -6 at -110/-112 elsewhere if you're confident in the Knicks covering by 7 or more. For the Pacers, FanDuel's +6 at -108 offers slightly better value than DraftKings.

3. **Totals:** DraftKings offers Under 225.5 at -108, which is slightly better than BetMGM's -110 for the same line. FanDuel has a slightly higher total at 226.

### Timberwolves vs Thunder Value Opportunities:

1. **Moneyline:** BetMGM offers significantly better value for both teams compared to other bookmakers:
   - Timberwolves at +125 (vs +136/+138 elsewhere)
   - Thunder at -150 (vs -162/-164 elsewhere)

2. **Spread:** BetMGM offers Thunder -3.5 at -105, which is better than the -110 at other bookmakers. If betting on the Timberwolves, FanDuel and DraftKings offer +3.5 at -110, better than BetMGM's -115.

3. **Totals:** BetMGM offers Under 217.5 at -105, which is better than DraftKings' -108 or FanDuel's -110 at 218.

## Making Recommendations

Without more detailed information on team form, injuries, and matchup dynamics, I'll need to rely on finding the best value in the existing markets. I'll make recommendations based on the odds differentials and some general NBA principles:

1. **Thunder Moneyline at BetMGM (-150)**: This represents the best value for the Thunder across bookmakers. The fact that they're favored on the road suggests oddsmakers believe they're significantly stronger than the Timberwolves.

2. **Knicks -6.5 at BetMGM (-102)**: The -102 odds provide better value than the standard -110 at other books, even with the extra half-point disadvantage. If the Knicks are strong at home, this could be worth the risk.

3. **Under 217.5 for Timberwolves vs Thunder at BetMGM (-105)**: Playoff games (assuming this is a playoff context) tend to be more defensive and lower scoring. This total line has good value at BetMGM.

4. **Pacers +6.5 at BetMGM (-118)**: While the odds aren't great, getting the extra half-point could be valuable in what might be a close game.

5. **Under 225.5 for Knicks vs Pacers at DraftKings (-108)**: Again, if this is a playoff situation, unders tend to have value, and this offers the best odds for this position.

Given the limited information, I'd generally recommend smaller stakes (1-3 units) rather than maximum confidence bets. I'll present these recommendations in the requested format in my final response.

Let me re-check my work to make sure I haven't missed anything:

Looking at the moneyline for the Timberwolves-Thunder game, I notice that BetMGM actually offers the best odds for BOTH teams (+125 for Timberwolves and -150 for Thunder). This is unusual and suggests there might be an arbitrage opportunity, but since I need to make concrete recommendations rather than suggest arbitrage, I'll stick with the Thunder moneyline as the better value bet.

For the totals in the Knicks-Pacers game, DraftKings offers 225.5 points with Under at -108, which is slightly better than BetMGM's Under at -110 for the same line.

With these considerations in mind, I'll finalize my recommendations.
