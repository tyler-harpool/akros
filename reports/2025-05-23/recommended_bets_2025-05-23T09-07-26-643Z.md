## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder @ Timberwolves | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 | 3 | BetMGM offers significantly better value than competitors (-162/-164 elsewhere). Road favorite status suggests strong team advantage that outweighs home court. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -102 | 2 | While losing a half-point on the spread, the -102 odds at BetMGM provide better value than standard -110/-112 for -6 elsewhere. Home court advantage amplifies this value. |
| Thunder @ Timberwolves | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best odds for this position. Late-season matchups often feature tighter defense and more deliberate offensive possessions. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 225.5 | -108 | 2 | DraftKings offers the best value for this position. The high total line provides room for value even if the teams play at a moderately fast pace. |
| Pacers @ Knicks | Spread (Alt) | Pacers +7.5 | -135 | 1 | Buying an extra point at DraftKings (line movement from +6 to +7.5) provides insurance against a close game where Knicks win by exactly 7. |

Without detailed lineup and injury information, these recommendations focus on identifying the best mathematical value across available markets rather than specific matchup advantages.
