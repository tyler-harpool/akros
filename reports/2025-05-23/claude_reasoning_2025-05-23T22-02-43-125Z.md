Key observations:

1. No lineup data is available for any team, which creates uncertainty.
2. No injury information is provided, which is a significant limitation.
3. No statistical edges are highlighted in the betting markets.
4. The Knicks are heavy favorites at home against the Pacers.
5. The Thunder are favorites on the road against the Timberwolves.

Let's analyze each game more deeply:

### Knicks vs Pacers Analysis:

The odds suggest the Knicks are significant favorites, with a spread of 5.5-6 points. This indicates the market believes the Knicks have a substantial advantage. Without lineup and injury information, I need to rely on the market consensus and the odds provided.

- The moneyline odds for the Knicks range from -258 to -250, which implies a win probability of approximately 71-72%.
- The Pacers' moneyline odds of +200 to +210 suggest about a 32-33% chance of winning.
- The total points line at 224.5 suggests expectations of a relatively high-scoring game.

Looking at the odds across bookmakers, I notice:
- BetMGM offers the best value for backing the Knicks at the spread with -5.5 (-115) compared to -6 at other bookmakers.
- For the total, DraftKings and FanDuel offer slightly better odds on the Under at -108.

### Timberwolves vs Thunder Analysis:

This game appears more competitive, with the Thunder as modest road favorites.

- The Thunder moneyline odds of -142 to -145 imply a win probability of approximately 58-59%.
- The Timberwolves odds of +118 to +120 suggest about a 45% chance of winning.
- The point spread of 2.5 points confirms the market sees this as a close game.
- The total points line of 217.5-218 suggests expectations of a moderately high-scoring game.

Looking at the odds across bookmakers:
- DraftKings offers the best value for backing the Timberwolves at the spread with +2.5 (-108).
- BetMGM offers a half-point lower total at 217.5, with -105 odds on the Under.

Now, let's consider potential betting recommendations:

1. **Pacers +6 (-110) at DraftKings/FanDuel**:
   - Rationale: While the Knicks are favored, 6 points is a substantial spread. Without knowing the lineup situations, taking the points with the underdog provides some cushion.
   - If the game is competitive, the Pacers could cover even in a loss.
   - Confidence level: Moderate (3 units)

2. **Knicks-Pacers Under 224.5 (-108) at DraftKings/FanDuel**:
   - Rationale: Playoff/tournament basketball (if applicable) tends to be more defensive-minded.
   - The Under often has value in higher total games where the market might be overestimating scoring.
   - Confidence level: Moderate (3 units)

3. **Timberwolves +2.5 (-108) at DraftKings**:
   - Rationale: Home underdogs often have value, especially in a close matchup with only a 2.5 point spread.
   - The -108 odds at DraftKings provide slightly better value than other bookmakers.
   - Confidence level: Moderate-High (4 units)

4. **Thunder ML -142 at DraftKings/FanDuel**:
   - Rationale: The Thunder being favored on the road suggests they're the stronger team.
   - The moneyline odds of -142 imply a win probability of about 59%, which may be value if they're the superior team.
   - Confidence level: Moderate (3 units)

5. **Timberwolves-Thunder Under 217.5 (-105) at BetMGM**:
   - Rationale: The half-point lower total at BetMGM (217.5 vs 218) could be significant in a close game.
   - The -105 odds provide better value than other bookmakers.
   - Confidence level: Moderate (3 units)

Let me finalize my 3-5 recommended bets, considering the limited information available:

1. **Pacers +6 (-110) at DraftKings** - 3 units
   Reasoning: Six points is a substantial cushion in what could be a competitive game. Without lineup information, taking the points with the underdog provides value.

2. **Knicks-Pacers Under 224.5 (-108) at DraftKings** - 3 units
   Reasoning: High total that may be overestimated. If this is a playoff/tournament context, we might see more defensive focus.

3. **Timberwolves +2.5 (-108) at DraftKings** - 4 units
   Reasoning: Home underdogs with a tight spread offer value, especially with the slightly better -108 odds.

4. **Thunder-Timberwolves Under 217.5 (-105) at BetMGM** - 3 units
   Reasoning: Half-point advantage on the total compared to other bookmakers, with favorable -105 odds.

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward based on the limited information available. The stakes reflect relative confidence in each bet, with higher units indicating stronger conviction.
