## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +13.5 | -120 (DraftKings) | 2 | IN-GAME VALUE: The 2-point spread difference between books (13.5 vs 15.5) creates value, especially if Minnesota shows any offensive rhythm. DraftKings line offers better value than FanDuel's 15.5. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Over 216.5 | -120 (FanDuel) | 3 | IN-GAME VALUE: This is the lowest available total across all books, creating a 2-point advantage over the 218.5 line at other sportsbooks. If game pace remains consistent, this line offers significant value. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 218.5 | -118 (BetMGM) | 2 | IN-GAME VALUE: If OKC maintains their large lead, we could see both teams empty their benches, leading to a scoring slowdown in the final quarter. BetMGM offers the best odds for this scenario. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -118 (BetMGM) | 2 | BetMGM offers the best line for Indiana backers with that extra half-point over the 6-point spread available at other books. In what should be a high-scoring game, that half-point could prove crucial. |

Remember that live betting markets move rapidly, so these recommendations are time-sensitive. Monitor the game flow closely before placing any wagers, particularly for the Thunder-Timberwolves contest already in progress.
