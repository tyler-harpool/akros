I'm being asked to analyze live in-game betting opportunities for two NBA games:
1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/21/2025)
2. New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (5/22/2025)

However, there's a discrepancy I need to clarify. The prompt states this is "LIVE IN-GAME" betting analysis, but the data appears to be pre-game information, as it has full game odds rather than in-game adjusted odds, and the games haven't started yet according to the timestamps provided. Additionally, there's no information about the current score, game time, or recent on-court events that would be needed for proper live betting analysis.

Since the data appears to be pre-game odds rather than live odds, I'll analyze the pre-game betting opportunities based on the information provided, while acknowledging this limitation.

Let's examine what we have for each game:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves

- **Moneyline**: OKC is heavily favored at home with odds between -300 and -325
- **Spread**: OKC favored by 7.5 points across all bookmakers
- **Total**: Set at 215.5-216.5, with a slight lean to the under at BetMGM

No lineup information is provided, and there's no mention of injuries. Without this critical information, it's difficult to make a detailed assessment of this matchup.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

- **Moneyline**: Knicks favored at home with odds between -180 and -190
- **Spread**: Knicks favored by 4-4.5 points
- **Total**: Set consistently at 223.5 across all bookmakers

Again, no lineup information or injury updates are provided.

Without current game state information, player stats, or lineup details, my analysis will have significant limitations. I'll need to make broader assessments based on the odds and typical NBA patterns.

Let me consider what bet recommendations I can confidently make with the limited information:

1. **Thunder vs Timberwolves spread**: The 7.5-point spread is substantial in a playoff context (assuming these are playoff games given the dates). Without knowing injuries or lineups, this is hard to assess, but playoff games often trend closer than regular season matchups.

2. **Knicks vs Pacers total**: The 223.5 total seems high for a potential playoff game, especially involving the Knicks who typically play at a slower pace under Tom Thibodeau.

3. **Knicks spread**: The 4-4.5 point spread at home suggests a moderately tight matchup. FanDuel offers the best value at -4 compared to -4.5 elsewhere.

4. **Thunder-Timberwolves total**: BetMGM has the total at 216.5 while others have it at 215.5, creating a small arbitrage opportunity if one had strong feelings about the total.

Given the information constraints and lack of live game data, I'll make recommendations based on historical playoff patterns and the value discrepancies in the odds provided, while acknowledging these limitations.

I'll recommend the following bets:

1. Timberwolves +7.5 points (BetMGM at -115): Playoff games tend to be tighter, and this is a substantial spread.

2. Knicks-Pacers Under 223.5 (FanDuel at -112): Playoff intensity often leads to lower scoring games, especially with the Knicks involved.

3. Knicks -4 points (FanDuel at -110): Better value than the -4.5 available elsewhere.

4. Thunder-Wolves Under 216.5 (BetMGM at -115): If you believe this will be a defensive struggle, BetMGM offers a higher total than other books.

I'll format these recommendations as requested, though I must note the significant limitations in analysis due to the lack of proper in-game data.
