## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 | Minnesota's defensive structure and Edwards' scoring should keep this competitive; 7.5 points provides significant cushion in what should be a playoff-intensity game. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 218 | -110 (FanDuel) | 4 | Both teams feature elite defensive personnel (Gobert, Holmgren) and playoff games typically feature heightened defensive intensity and slower pace. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 224.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | Taking advantage of the highest total offering; Knicks' defensive identity under Thibodeau should help control pace, especially in a home playoff environment. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +162 (FanDuel) | 1 | Small-value play on the Pacers, who have the offensive firepower to potentially upset; best underdog odds available across bookmakers. |

Note: Stakes represent confidence level from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Exercise appropriate bankroll management when placing these wagers.
