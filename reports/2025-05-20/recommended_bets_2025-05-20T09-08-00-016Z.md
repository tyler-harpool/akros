## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs. Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 units | Thunder's elite starting five led by SGA should exploit matchup advantages at home. BetMGM offers the best price for this spread. |
| Thunder vs. Timberwolves | Total | Under 216.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Both teams feature elite rim protectors (Gobert, Holmgren/Hartenstein) that should limit interior scoring. The slightly higher total at BetMGM provides better value. |
| Knicks vs. Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Knicks as home favorites with the best available odds across bookmakers. FanDuel offers superior value at -106 compared to -110 elsewhere. |
| Knicks vs. Pacers | Total | Over 223 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | DraftKings offers the slightly lower total (223 vs 223.5), providing better value for the over bet in what projects to be an up-tempo game. |

These recommendations leverage the best available odds across different sportsbooks while considering the projected lineups and game contexts. The stake sizes reflect confidence levels based on available information.
