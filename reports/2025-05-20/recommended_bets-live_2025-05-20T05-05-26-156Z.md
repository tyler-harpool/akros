## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -110 | 3 | Minnesota's elite defense gives them cover ability even when trailing. BetMGM offers the best value with -115, creating a strong live play if the current deficit is manageable. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 216.5 | -115 | 4 | Both teams rank among the better defensive units, and playoff intensity typically reduces scoring. BetMGM's higher total (216.5) offers slight additional cushion. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +162 | 2 | Best value at FanDuel (+162) for Indiana's explosive offense that can erase deficits quickly with their pace and three-point shooting. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -114 | 3 | Indiana's pace and scoring ability make them dangerous to pull within this margin late, especially if they're showing signs of offensive rhythm in the current game state. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 223.5 | -108 | 3 | Combines Indiana's up-tempo style with New York's half-court efficiency. FanDuel offers the best odds and the game total has the potential to escalate in later quarters. |

Remember that live betting requires quick assessment of momentum and current game flow, which would significantly enhance these recommendations with actual in-game data.
