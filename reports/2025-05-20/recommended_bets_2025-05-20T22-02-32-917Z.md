## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 | Minnesota's defensive identity with Gobert and veteran leadership from Conley should keep this competitive. The 7-point cushion provides solid value. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 218.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | Both teams feature elite defensive players (Gobert, Holmgren, McDaniels, Dort) which should lead to a lower-scoring, playoff-style intensity. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 2 | Best price available for the Knicks spread, offering value over the standard -110 at other sportsbooks. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +162 (FanDuel) | 1 | Highest available odds on the Pacers, providing good underdog value in what should be a competitive matchup. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 224 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | The half-point advantage over BetMGM's 224.5 provides small but meaningful edge for a game projected to have more offensive pace. |

Remember to always manage your bankroll responsibly and consider these recommendations within your overall betting strategy.
