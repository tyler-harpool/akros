I need to analyze the current live betting opportunities for two NBA games: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers.

First, let me note that the information provided is somewhat limited:
- We don't have current lineup information for any of the teams
- We don't have injury reports
- We don't have live game state information - like the current score, quarter, or time remaining
- We don't have recent performance metrics for the teams involved

Without this information, especially the current game state, my live in-game analysis will be more limited than ideal. However, I can still provide reasonable analysis based on the odds data and my knowledge of these teams.

Let's start by examining the betting markets for each game:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves

### Moneyline
- Home team (Thunder) is heavily favored: -310 to -325 across bookmakers
- Away team (Timberwolves) is the underdog: +245 to +260

### Spread
- Thunder favored by 7.5 points across all bookmakers
- Odds are relatively standard at around -110 on both sides

### Totals
- The total is set at 215.5 points at FanDuel and DraftKings, and 216.5 at BetMGM
- There's a slight lean toward the under at BetMGM (-115 under vs -105 over)

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

### Moneyline
- Home team (Knicks) is moderately favored: -180 to -194 across bookmakers
- Away team (Pacers) is the underdog: +150 to +162

### Spread
- Knicks favored by 4.5 points across all bookmakers
- Odds are relatively standard at around -110 on both sides, with FanDuel offering slightly better value on the Knicks at -106

### Totals
- The total is consistently set at 223.5 points across all bookmakers
- FanDuel has a slight lean toward the under at -112 (vs -108 for the over)

Now, let me consider what I know about these teams and their potential matchups, even without current game state information:

## Thunder vs Timberwolves Analysis

The Thunder are substantial favorites at home, with the spread at 7.5 points. This suggests the market sees this as a relatively one-sided matchup or that the Thunder have already built a substantial lead if this is live in-game betting.

The Thunder are likely led by their star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, with support from players like Chet Holmgren and Luguentz Dort. They typically play an efficient offensive style with strong perimeter defense.

The Timberwolves are built around Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Rudy Gobert. They have a strong defensive identity with Gobert anchoring the paint, but can sometimes struggle with offensive consistency.

The total of 215.5-216.5 suggests a moderate-scoring game, which aligns with both teams' defensive capabilities.

## Knicks vs Pacers Analysis

The Knicks being favored by 4.5 points at home suggests a competitive but home-leaning matchup. New York would likely be relying on Jalen Brunson as their primary offensive engine, with players like Julius Randle and OG Anunoby providing support (assuming these players are still on the roster in 2025).

The Pacers are likely still playing their up-tempo, offensively-focused style led by Tyrese Haliburton, with supporting players like Myles Turner providing interior defense.

The total of 223.5 is notably higher than the Thunder-Wolves game, reflecting the Pacers' typically faster pace and the likelihood of a more offensive-oriented contest.

Now, let me think about potential live betting opportunities:

Without knowing the current game state, I need to be cautious. However, I can still identify potential value based on the odds and my understanding of these teams:

1. For Thunder-Wolves, the 7.5 point spread is substantial. If the Thunder are already leading by around that margin or more, the Wolves might present value on the spread if they've shown any signs of mounting a comeback. Conversely, if the Thunder are trailing or only leading by a small margin, there might be value in backing them to cover the spread if they've been showing offensive momentum.

2. For the totals, 215.5-216.5 in the Thunder-Wolves game reflects both teams' defensive capabilities. If scoring has been lower than expected in the first half or early quarters, there might be value in the under, especially if key offensive players are struggling.

3. For Knicks-Pacers, the 4.5 point spread suggests a closer game. If the Pacers are keeping it competitive or even leading, their +150 to +162 moneyline odds might offer value. Alternatively, if the Knicks have momentum and are pulling away, backing them to cover the 4.5 spread could be worthwhile.

4. The higher 223.5 total for Knicks-Pacers reflects the expected faster pace. If the game has started slower than anticipated or if defense has been surprisingly effective, the under might offer value.

Given the limited information, I'll make recommendations that could be adjusted based on the actual game state:

Recommendations:

1. Minnesota Timberwolves +7.5 points (-110) at FanDuel or DraftKings - This becomes especially valuable if the Wolves are showing any signs of offensive rhythm or if the Thunder's lead (if they have one) is less than 7-8 points. The Wolves have the defensive talent to keep games closer than expected.

2. Under 216.5 points (-115) in Thunder-Wolves at BetMGM - Both teams have strong defensive identities, and playoff-type games (assuming these are important games) often tighten up defensively as they progress.

3. Indiana Pacers +4.5 points (-110) at DraftKings - The Pacers' offensive firepower makes them dangerous even when trailing. If they're within striking distance, this spread offers value.

4. Over 223.5 points (-108) in Knicks-Pacers at FanDuel - This game features two teams that can score in bunches, particularly the Pacers who play at a faster pace. If the first quarter or half has featured efficient offense, this becomes even more attractive.

5. Pacers Moneyline +162 at FanDuel - This offers the best odds across bookmakers if you believe the Pacers can win outright, which becomes more valuable if they're currently leading or only trailing by a small margin.

I'll format these into a proper recommendation table, acknowledging that these recommendations would ideally be fine-tuned based on the current game state.
