Let's analyze the available betting opportunities for the two NBA games.

## Context Assessment

First, I notice we're analyzing NBA betting opportunities **live/in-game**, which means we need to focus on how the current game dynamics are creating betting value.

The two games being analyzed are:
1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)
2. New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (5/22/2025)

However, there's something unusual here. The first game (Thunder vs Nuggets) is dated for 5/18/2025 (today) at 7:40 PM, but the second game (Knicks vs Pacers) is dated 5/22/2025, which is 4 days in the future. This suggests the second game isn't actually live right now.

I also note that:
- No statistical edges are identified
- No lineup data is available for any team
- No injury information is provided
- We don't have any information about the current score, time remaining, or recent game flow

For a proper live betting analysis, I would need current game state information such as:
- Current score
- Time remaining in the quarter/game
- Recent momentum shifts
- Player performance in the current game
- Foul trouble situations
- Any in-game injuries that have occurred

Without this crucial live game information, I need to be cautious with my recommendations and rely on more general NBA knowledge about these teams and their matchups.

## Team Analysis

Let's analyze what we know about these teams based on their typical performance:

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

Based on the betting lines:
- Denver is heavily favored (-325 to -340 moneyline odds)
- Spread is around 8-8.5 points in Denver's favor
- Total is set at 213.5 points (relatively low, suggesting a defensive game)

Denver Nuggets are typically a strong home team, especially in the playoffs, led by Nikola Jokic. They generally play at a slower pace and rely on half-court execution.

Oklahoma City Thunder are a young team led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, with promising talent but less playoff experience.

The odds suggest Denver has significant advantages in this matchup and are expected to win comfortably.

### New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

Based on the betting lines:
- New York is moderately favored (-175 to -185 moneyline odds)
- Spread is around 4-4.5 points in New York's favor
- Total is set at 222.5-223 points (relatively high, suggesting an offensive game)

The Knicks tend to play a more defensive style under Tom Thibodeau, while the Pacers typically play at a faster pace with more offense.

The betting lines suggest a competitive game with the Knicks having home court advantage.

## Betting Strategy for Live NBA Games

For live NBA betting, I would typically look for:

1. **Momentum shifts**: Teams that are making a run or showing strong defensive stands
2. **Lineup advantages**: When certain player combinations on the floor create mismatches
3. **Foul trouble**: Key players in foul trouble that might affect team performance
4. **Shooting variance**: Teams shooting well above or below their season averages (regression to the mean)
5. **Rest and fatigue**: Signs of fatigue in teams playing back-to-backs or in later quarters
6. **Pace changes**: Teams speeding up or slowing down the game unexpectedly

Without current game state information, my recommendations will need to be more general and based on overall team tendencies and betting line value.

## Potential Betting Opportunities

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

Given the large spread (8-8.5 points) and the fact that playoff games often tighten up as they progress, there might be value in:

1. Taking the Thunder at +8.5 if the game is close in the first half
2. Looking at the under (213.5) if both teams are playing good defense early
3. Denver moneyline if they're trailing early but showing signs of adjusting

### New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

With a higher total (222.5-223) and a tighter spread (4-4.5 points):

1. The over could be valuable if both teams are shooting well early
2. Pacers +4.5 might offer value if they're keeping it close or leading
3. Knicks moneyline if they're trailing but their defense is tightening up

## Best Odds Available

Let me identify the best available odds for each potential bet:

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets
- Thunder +8.5: Best at DraftKings (+8 -108)
- Under 213.5: Best at DraftKings (-108)
- Nuggets ML: Best at FanDuel (-340)

### New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers
- Over 223: Standard across books (-110)
- Pacers +4.5: Best at FanDuel (-114)
- Knicks ML: Best at DraftKings (-175)

## Recommended Bets

Given the limited information, I'll make some conditional recommendations based on what might be happening in the Thunder-Nuggets game (the only one that should be live now), and some pre-game analysis for the upcoming Knicks-Pacers game.

For the Thunder-Nuggets game, without knowing the current state, I can't make highly specific recommendations, but I can suggest some typical live betting scenarios based on the odds:

1. If the Nuggets are leading by less than the spread (8 points) but controlling the game, a Nuggets -8 (-112) at DraftKings might be valuable.
2. If the total score pace is below the projected 213.5 point total and defensive intensity is high, the Under 213.5 (-108) at DraftKings offers value.
3. If the Thunder are keeping it close or leading, their +8 (-108) at DraftKings would be valuable.

For the Knicks-Pacers game, this appears to be a pre-game analysis:

1. Based on the offensive potential of both teams, Over 223 (-110) is worth considering.
2. The Pacers at +4.5 (-114) at FanDuel offers decent value if you believe they can keep it competitive.

Now I'll formalize these into recommended bets, but I'll need to be careful about the Thunder-Nuggets game since I don't have the actual live context.

WAIT! I just realized I've been making a fundamental mistake in my analysis. I need to be careful about making conditional recommendations, as the instructions clearly ask for concrete bet recommendations, not hypothetical ones. Without knowing the current live game state, it's difficult to make specific in-game betting recommendations.

Let me adjust my approach. I'll provide recommendations that might be reasonable given typical game flow patterns in the NBA, particularly for playoff games between teams like these. However, I must emphasize that live betting requires current game state information for truly informed decisions.

For my final recommendations, I'll focus on what might be reasonable bets given the odds provided and typical NBA game dynamics:
