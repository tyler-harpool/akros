## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Underdogs tend to play tighter in playoff situations, and the extra half-point gives valuable protection against a key number. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Playoff intensity typically leads to more defensive focus and slower possessions, especially in close games. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +154 (FanDuel) | 2 | Best underdog value on the board; Pacers' fast-paced style can create upset potential if they catch fire from 3-point range. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 | The best available spread for the Knicks with half-point value compared to other books offering -4.5. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 222.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | With both teams healthy (assuming no major injuries), this total is achievable and represents the lowest available line across all books. |

For live betting, I recommend waiting for significant momentum shifts or lineup changes to find better value than these pre-game lines. The Pacers moneyline in particular could become more valuable if the Knicks have a slow start, potentially offering even better odds.
