Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities presented based on the provided data. I'll need to carefully consider the live betting situation for the Thunder vs Nuggets game which is already in progress, as well as the upcoming games.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (IN PROGRESS)

This game is currently in progress with some extremely large spread odds indicating the Thunder are likely winning by a substantial margin. Let's examine what we have:

Spread Odds:
- FanDuel: Thunder -42.5 (-112), Nuggets +42.5 (-118)
- DraftKings: Thunder -31.5 (-220), Nuggets +31.5 (170)
- BetMGM: Thunder -33.5 (-125), Nuggets +33.5 (-105)

Totals:
- FanDuel: 220.5 (Over -102, Under -130)
- DraftKings: 218.5 (Over 140, Under -180)

The very large point spreads (-31.5 to -42.5) indicate the Thunder are likely dominating this game by a huge margin. The significant variation between sportsbooks (FanDuel at -42.5 vs DraftKings at -31.5) suggests there might be some uncertainty in the live betting markets.

For the totals, both books are favoring the Under (especially DraftKings at -180), suggesting the scoring pace is expected to slow down significantly. This often happens in blowouts when bench players enter the game.

Without knowing the exact score, quarter, and time remaining, I'll have to make some assumptions: this appears to be a major blowout with OKC in command, likely with bench players already in or soon to enter the game.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves (UPCOMING)

For this upcoming game on 5/21/2025:

Moneyline:
- FanDuel: Thunder -310, Timberwolves +250
- DraftKings: Thunder -305, Timberwolves +245

Spread:
- FanDuel: Thunder -7.5 (-108), Timberwolves +7.5 (-112)
- DraftKings: Thunder -7.5 (-112), Timberwolves +7.5 (-108)

Totals:
- FanDuel: 212.5 (Over -110, Under -110)
- DraftKings: 213.5 (Over -110, Under -110)

The Thunder are heavy favorites at home, with a 7.5-point spread across both books. The totals are set at 212.5-213.5, suggesting the market expects a relatively moderate-scoring game. The consistency between bookmakers indicates a generally efficient market for this game.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (UPCOMING)

For this upcoming game on 5/22/2025:

Moneyline:
- DraftKings: Knicks -180, Pacers +150
- FanDuel: Knicks -184, Pacers +154
- BetMGM: Knicks -185, Pacers +150

Spread:
- DraftKings: Knicks -4 (-110), Pacers +4 (-110)
- FanDuel: Knicks -4.5 (-106), Pacers +4.5 (-114)
- BetMGM: Knicks -4.5 (-105), Pacers +4.5 (-115)

Totals:
- DraftKings: 223 (Over -110, Under -110)
- FanDuel: 223 (Over -110, Under -110)
- BetMGM: 222.5 (Over -115, Under -105)

The Knicks are moderate favorites at home with spreads of -4 to -4.5 points. The slight variation in spread between DraftKings (-4) and the other books (-4.5) presents a potential opportunity for value. The total points market is very consistent across books at 222.5-223, with slight differences in the juice.

Now let's analyze each opportunity more deeply and develop recommendations:

### Analysis for Thunder vs Nuggets (In Progress)

Without knowing the exact score and time remaining, it's difficult to make a precise recommendation. However, based on the spreads and totals:

1. The large variation in point spread between FanDuel (-42.5) and DraftKings (-31.5) suggests potential value on the Nuggets +42.5 at FanDuel if:
   - The game is in the late 3rd quarter or 4th quarter
   - Both teams have already brought in bench players
   - Denver has shown any signs of making small runs to cut into the lead

2. The totals market heavily favors the Under, especially at DraftKings (Under 218.5 at -180). This suggests:
   - The scoring pace has slowed or is expected to slow significantly
   - Bench players are likely in the game
   - Teams might be running out the clock rather than pushing the pace

Given the heavy juice on the Under (-180 at DraftKings), I'm not seeing great value there. However, there might be value on the Nuggets +42.5 points at FanDuel, as this is an extremely large spread even for a blowout, and garbage time can often lead to the losing team cutting the margin slightly.

### Analysis for Thunder vs Timberwolves (Upcoming)

This is likely a Western Conference playoff matchup. The Thunder are favored by 7.5 points at home, which seems reasonable if they've been performing well (which they apparently are based on the current Nuggets game).

Looking at the odds:
- There's no significant difference between bookmakers in the spread market
- The total points are slightly different (212.5 at FanDuel vs 213.5 at DraftKings)

Without injury or lineup information for this game, it's difficult to identify a clear edge. However, it's worth noting that playoff basketball often features tighter defensive efforts and can trend toward the under, especially in competitive series.

If the Thunder are dominating their current game against the Nuggets (who were champions recently), that suggests they're in excellent form, which might justify the 7.5-point spread against Minnesota.

### Analysis for Knicks vs Pacers (Upcoming)

This appears to be an Eastern Conference playoff matchup. The Knicks are moderate favorites at home with spreads ranging from -4 (DraftKings) to -4.5 (FanDuel/BetMGM).

The half-point difference in spread presents a potential opportunity:
- DraftKings offers Knicks -4 (-110)
- FanDuel offers Knicks -4.5 (-106)
- The 0.5 point difference is significant in NBA betting, as many games end with margins of 4-5 points

Additionally, there's a slight difference in the total points market:
- DraftKings and FanDuel set at 223 points
- BetMGM set at 222.5 points with Over at -115 and Under at -105

The Under 223 at DraftKings/FanDuel (-110) appears to offer slightly better value than Under 222.5 at BetMGM (-105), if you believe the game will be lower-scoring.

Based on my analysis, here are my recommendations:

1. For Thunder vs Nuggets (Live): Consider Nuggets +42.5 (-118) at FanDuel if the game is in the late stages. This is an extremely large spread that might be an overreaction to the current game state.

2. For Knicks vs Pacers: Knicks -4 (-110) at DraftKings offers better value than Knicks -4.5 at the other books. That half-point could be crucial in a competitive playoff game.

3. For Thunder vs Timberwolves: The Under 213.5 (-110) at DraftKings might have value if this is indeed a playoff matchup, as playoff intensity often leads to tighter defense and more deliberate offensive possessions.

4. For Knicks vs Pacers: Under 223 (-110) at DraftKings/FanDuel might represent value if you anticipate a physical, defensive-oriented playoff game.

Without more specific information on team form, injuries, and the exact state of the in-progress game, these recommendations are based on the odds discrepancies and general tendencies in similar situations.

Let me finalize my recommendations for the "RECOMMENDED BETS" section:

1. Nuggets +42.5 (-118) at FanDuel - This is an extremely large spread and there's significant discrepancy between bookmakers, suggesting potential value. 2 units.

2. Knicks -4 (-110) at DraftKings - The half-point advantage compared to other books (-4.5) provides meaningful value in a game expected to be competitive. 3 units.

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves Under 213.5 (-110) at DraftKings - Playoff basketball often trends toward the under due to increased defensive intensity. 2 units.

4. Pacers +4.5 (-114) at FanDuel - Taking the extra half-point on the underdog provides additional security in what could be a close game. 2 units.

5. Thunder vs Nuggets Under 220.5 (-130) at FanDuel - In blowout situations with bench players, scoring typically decreases in the late stages. 1 unit (lower stake due to heavy juice).

Let me review the odds to ensure I'm using accurate values from the data:

1. Nuggets +42.5 (-118) at FanDuel ✓
2. Knicks -4 (-110) at DraftKings ✓
3. Thunder vs Timberwolves Under 213.5 (-110) at DraftKings ✓
4. Pacers +4.5 (-114) at FanDuel ✓
5. Thunder vs Nuggets Under 220.5 (-130) at FanDuel ✓

These odds are accurate according to the provided data. I'll now format my recommendations according to the requested structure.
