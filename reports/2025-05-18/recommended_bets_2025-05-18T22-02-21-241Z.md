## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +42.5 | -118 | 3 units | IN-GAME recommendation: This is an extremely large spread with significant discrepancy between bookmakers (11 points), suggesting value on the underdog. Even in blowouts, garbage time often allows trailing teams to cut into massive leads. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4 | -110 | 4 units | Getting the Knicks at -4 vs -4.5 elsewhere provides significant value. This half-point could be crucial in a competitive playoff game and represents clear line shopping value. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 213.5 | -110 | 3 units | Playoff basketball typically features increased defensive intensity and more deliberate offensive possessions. OKC ranks among the better defensive teams, and Minnesota has elite defensive personnel. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 220.5 | -130 | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation: With a blowout clearly in progress, expect scoring pace to decrease significantly as bench players enter and starters rest. The heavy juice indicates strong market sentiment toward the under. |
| Pacers vs Knicks | Moneyline | Pacers | +154 | 1 unit | While Knicks are favored at home, Pacers' offensive firepower provides upset potential at attractive odds. This serves as a hedge against our Knicks spread bet while offering positive expected value. |
