Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the NBA games on Sunday, May 18, 2025. I'm provided with odds for two games: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers.

First, I should note that we're asked to analyze LIVE in-game betting opportunities, but the data provided doesn't seem to show in-game odds or the current game state. Instead, it appears to be pre-game odds. The games are listed as starting at 5/18/2025, 7:40:00 PM for Thunder vs Nuggets and 5/22/2025, 12:05:00 AM for Knicks vs Pacers.

Also, there are no lineups provided, no injury reports, and no statistical edges identified. This significantly limits my ability to provide thorough in-game analysis.

Nevertheless, I'll try to work with what I have and make reasonable recommendations based on the odds provided.

Let's examine the odds for each game:

**Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets**
- The Nuggets are significant favorites with moneyline odds ranging from -325 to -335
- The spread is between -8 and -8.5 in favor of the Nuggets
- The total points line is consistently set at 213.5

**New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers**
- The Knicks are moderate favorites with moneyline odds ranging from -175 to -185
- The spread is between -4 and -4.5 in favor of the Knicks
- The total points line is between 222.5 and 223

Without current game state information, it's difficult to make specific in-game betting recommendations. However, I can analyze the pre-game odds for potential value.

For the Nuggets vs Thunder game:
- The Nuggets are heavily favored, suggesting they're the significantly stronger team
- The total of 213.5 suggests a moderate-scoring game rather than a high-scoring affair

For the Knicks vs Pacers game:
- The Knicks are modest favorites at home
- The total of 222.5-223 suggests expectations of a higher-scoring game than the Nuggets-Thunder matchup

Since I'm asked to provide 3-5 specific bet recommendations despite the limited information, I'll base my recommendations on:
1. Looking for the best odds across bookmakers
2. Considering standard NBA game dynamics and playoff implications
3. Making reasonable assumptions about how games might unfold

Let me create my recommendations:

**Game 1: Nuggets vs Thunder**
1. Spread bet on Thunder +8.5 at DraftKings (-108): In playoff scenarios (assuming these are playoff games given the May timing), large spreads often tighten as underdogs tend to play with high intensity.

2. Under 213.5 at DraftKings (-108): Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and more deliberate offense, making unders slightly more valuable.

**Game 2: Knicks vs Pacers**
3. Moneyline on Pacers at DraftKings (+145): This offers the best underdog value across the bookmakers.

4. Over 222.5 at BetMGM (-115): If the Pacers are involved, their fast-paced style could lead to a higher-scoring game.

5. Knicks -4 at DraftKings (-110): This is the smallest spread available for the Knicks, providing slightly better value than the -4.5 available elsewhere.

Now I'll format these into the required recommendation table with appropriate stakes and reasoning.
