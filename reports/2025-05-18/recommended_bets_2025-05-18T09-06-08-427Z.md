## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | OKC's athletic defense and Holmgren's rim protection should keep this competitive. DraftKings offers the best spread value, with the extra half-point compared to other books providing crucial insurance in a potential single-digit game. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Both teams feature strong defensive units, and Denver tends to play at a controlled pace with Jokic as their offensive hub. Playoff-caliber matchups typically trend toward lower-scoring affairs as defensive intensity increases. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 2 units | While the Knicks hold home court, the 4.5-point cushion provides solid value for the Pacers. Without detailed lineup information, taking the points in what projects as a competitive game represents the prudent approach. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | BetMGM offers the best value with the half-point advantage over other books. Late-season matchups often feature increased defensive focus, and this total appears slightly inflated given the playoff implications. |

These selections balance potential value with reasonable risk management based on the available information.
