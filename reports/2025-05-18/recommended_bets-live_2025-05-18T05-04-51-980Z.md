## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 | Best value on Thunder spread across books, playoff games typically tighten in later stages |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Playoff intensity often leads to defensive adjustments as games progress |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Alt Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | +140 (FanDuel) | 1 | If Nuggets lead but by less than the spread, this offers good value while accounting for potential comeback |  
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 223 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | Pacers' up-tempo style combined with Knicks' improving offense suggests scoring potential |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 2 | Pacers have shown resilience and line movement suggests slight value on the underdog |

Note: For truly optimal live betting, decisions should incorporate current score, momentum, and in-game developments. The Thunder-Nuggets recommendations assume standard game flow patterns in playoff matchups with similar pre-game expectations.
