## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Playoff games typically tighten, and SGA's scoring ability can keep this within single digits. This spread is generous for a playoff game with OKC's talented roster. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Playoff intensity often leads to stronger defensive efforts and more deliberate possessions. Both teams have capable defenders who should shine in this high-stakes matchup. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 | Road underdogs in playoff situations tend to outperform market expectations. The 4.5-point cushion provides value in what projects to be a competitive series. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and more half-court sets. The line appears slightly high for a potential grind-it-out postseason matchup. |

These recommendations balance the statistical factors with the contextual elements of playoff basketball, where games are often more competitive and defensive-oriented than regular season matchups.
