Let me analyze the data provided to make recommendations for live NBA betting opportunities. The main game that's currently in progress is Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers, so I'll focus particularly on that one while also providing analysis for upcoming games.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (IN PROGRESS)

From the data, I can see:
- The Cavaliers have an extremely heavy favorite moneyline of -10000
- The spread is at Cavaliers -27.5 points
- The total is set at 239.5 points

These odds suggest the Cavaliers have built a massive lead in this game. A 27.5 point spread for a live game indicates the Cavaliers are dominating the Pacers. Both teams have their regular starters on the floor according to the lineup information.

Without knowing exactly what quarter the game is in or the exact score, I need to make some inferences:
- The extreme moneyline (-10000) suggests we're in the late stages of a blowout
- The total of 239.5 suggests either we're late in the game with a lot of points already scored, or the pace has been extremely fast

For live betting analysis:
1. With such a large spread (-27.5), there might be value in the Pacers spread if the Cavaliers pull their starters in the fourth quarter with such a big lead.
2. The total of 239.5 could be interesting - if we're in the late stages of the game, the pace might slow down significantly with bench players and a decided outcome.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (Upcoming)

This game appears to have Boston as a clear favorite:
- Moneyline: Boston -245 to -255 across books
- Spread: Boston -6.5 consistently across books
- Total: 208.5 to 209 points

No lineup data is available yet. This is a playoff matchup between two defensive-minded teams, which explains the relatively low total of around 209.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (Upcoming)

Minnesota is favored:
- Moneyline: Minnesota -220 to -225
- Spread: Minnesota -5.5
- Total: 199.5 to 200.5 (very low by NBA standards)

The total is particularly low, suggesting a slower-paced, defensive battle is expected.

## Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers (Upcoming)

This appears to be the next game in the series between these teams:
- Moneyline: Cavaliers -320 to -325
- Spread: Cavaliers -8
- Total: 229.5 to 230

The Cavaliers are substantial favorites at home.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (Upcoming)

OKC is heavily favored:
- Moneyline: OKC -460 to -500
- Spread: OKC -10.5
- Total: 220.5 to 221.5

Without more detailed information about the in-progress game (Pacers vs Cavaliers), my live betting analysis is somewhat limited. However, I can make some reasonable recommendations based on the extreme line movements evident in the live betting odds.

Let me put together 3-5 recommended bets, focusing particularly on the live game opportunities where possible, and supplementing with pre-game bets for the upcoming contests.

### Live Game Recommendation Analysis:

For the Pacers vs Cavaliers game currently in progress:

1. **Pacers +27.5 (-112 at FanDuel)**: In blowout scenarios, when a team is up by 25+ points, they often rest their stars in the 4th quarter. This can lead to the trailing team cutting into the lead somewhat as they play against bench players. The extreme spread suggests this is already a decided game, and there could be value in taking the Pacers to cover this massive number if the Cavaliers go deep into their bench.

2. **Under 239.5 (-135 at DraftKings)**: The high total and the lopsided nature of the game suggests we might see a slower pace down the stretch. If both teams are playing bench players, the scoring efficiency typically drops. Additionally, in blowouts, the winning team often takes their foot off the gas and milks the clock, leading to fewer possessions.

For upcoming games:

3. **Timberwolves-Warriors Under 199.5 (-110 at DraftKings)**: This is an extremely low total, but it's justified given the teams involved. Minnesota has been one of the best defensive teams in the league, and playoff basketball typically sees intensified defense and slower pace. If both teams are committed to their defensive identities, this could stay under the total.

4. **Celtics -6.5 (-110 at FanDuel)**: Boston has been the best team in the league all season, and they tend to execute extremely well in playoff settings. The 6.5-point spread is reasonable given their superiority, and they've shown the ability to pull away from teams with their efficient offense and stifling defense.

5. **Thunder -10.5 (-105 at BetMGM)**: OKC has been impressive all season and if they have home court advantage against Denver, they could potentially dominate this matchup. The -10.5 at -105 gives slightly better odds than the other books.

Those would be my 5 recommended bets based on the information available. Without knowing the exact situation in the live Pacers-Cavaliers game, my recommendations for that contest are based on general trends in blowout NBA games.
