## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers @ Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +27.5 | -112 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Cleveland likely to rest starters with such a large lead, allowing Pacers reserves to trim the final margin against Cavs' bench players. |
| Pacers @ Cavaliers | Total | Under 239.5 | -135 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Game pace typically slows significantly in late-game blowout situations as the leading team burns clock and both teams play reserve units. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 199.5 | -110 | 4 | Minnesota brings elite defense that has frustrated opponents all season, while Golden State's offense has been inconsistent. Playoff intensity will further suppress scoring. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder -10.5 | -105 | 3 | OKC has the athleticism and depth to potentially dominate Denver, especially at home. BetMGM offers the best value at -105 compared to other books. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics -6.5 | -110 | 3 | Boston has demonstrated consistent playoff execution and superior depth. Their offensive efficiency should allow them to pull away and cover against a Knicks team that struggles to score consistently. |

Remember that for live betting recommendations, timing is crucial as odds will continue to shift rapidly based on game events.
