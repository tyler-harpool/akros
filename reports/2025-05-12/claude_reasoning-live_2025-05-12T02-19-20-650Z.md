Let me analyze the provided information for live betting opportunities, focusing on the Indiana Pacers vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game that's currently in progress, as well as the upcoming games.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (IN PROGRESS)

Based on the moneyline odds (-10000 for Cavaliers, +3300 for Pacers), it appears that the Cavaliers have a massive lead in this game. This is confirmed by the spread odds, which range from -28.5 to -31.5 for Cleveland. This indicates that Cleveland is currently up by approximately 30 points, which is a very substantial lead.

The total points line is set at around 240.5-241.5, with slightly heavier juice on the under. This suggests that the pace of the game may be slowing down as Cleveland protects their lead or that the game has been high-scoring up to this point.

Without knowing the exact game state (score, quarter, time remaining), I can infer that:

1. Cleveland is dominating this game by around 30 points
2. The bookmakers expect the game to slow down somewhat (juice on the under)
3. The game is likely in the late stages, as the moneyline odds are extremely lopsided

For a live betting opportunity here, I would need to consider:
- If Cleveland's bench players will come in, potentially allowing Indiana to cut into the lead
- Whether garbage time scoring with less defensive intensity might push the total over
- If the massive spread provides any value for Indiana if they can make a small run

## Upcoming Games Analysis

For the upcoming games, I'll look for betting opportunities based on matchups, trends, and potential value in the lines.

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Boston is a clear favorite (-245 to -255 moneyline, -6.5 spread)
- Total points set at around 208.5-209, indicating bookmakers expect a moderate scoring game

### Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Minnesota is favored (-220 to -225 moneyline, -5.5 spread)
- Low total of 199.5-200.5 indicates an expected defensive battle

### Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers (Next Game)
- Cleveland favored at home (-290 to -325 moneyline, -8 spread)
- Higher total of 229.5-230 suggests bookmakers expect more scoring than in other matchups

- OKC heavily favored at home (-460 to -500 moneyline, -10.5 spread)
- Moderate total of 220.5-221.5

I don't have detailed information about team momentum, injuries, or recent performance for these upcoming games, which limits my ability to make strong recommendations. However, I'll try to identify potential value based on the lines provided.

## Recommended Bets Analysis

For the live game (Pacers vs. Cavaliers):
1. **Pacers +31.5 (-115)** - With such a large spread, there might be value on the Pacers if the Cavaliers empty their bench in a blowout. The variance between sportsbooks (28.5 to 31.5) suggests some uncertainty in the line. Taking the largest available spread at DraftKings could offer some value.

2. **Under 241.5 (-122)** - With a blowout in progress, the pace often slows down as teams empty their benches and the winning team becomes less aggressive offensively. The juice is already leaning toward the under, suggesting market sentiment agrees.

For the upcoming games:

3. **Warriors +5.5 (-110)** - Golden State tends to play competitive games, and this spread feels slightly higher than it should be against a Minnesota team they match up well with. The Warriors' shooting can keep them in games against anyone.

4. **Celtics/Knicks Under 209 (-110)** - Playoff basketball between these defensive-minded teams often results in lower-scoring affairs. Both teams will emphasize defensive intensity in this matchup.

5. **Thunder -10.5 (-110)** - OKC has been dominant at home, and their young, energetic team should be able to handle the Nuggets, who may be showing fatigue at this point in the season.

Given that I have limited context on team form, injuries, and recent performances, these recommendations are based primarily on the odds provided and general basketball knowledge. For stronger recommendations, I would need more detailed information about the current state of these teams.

Now let me organize these into the required format for the "RECOMMENDED BETS" section.
