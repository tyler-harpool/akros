Alright, I'm tasked with analyzing NBA betting opportunities for games on May 12-14, 2025. Let me break down the available information:

# Games Being Analyzed
1. New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/12/2025, 11:35:00 PM)

## Potential Betting Angles

Without detailed team information, I'll focus on identifying value based on odds discrepancies between bookmakers and reasonable assumptions about playoff basketball:

1. **Knicks vs Celtics**: Given the playoff context (assuming these are playoff games based on the dates), the Knicks at +6.5 points could be valuable. Playoff games often tighten up, and underdogs tend to cover larger spreads.

2. **Warriors vs Timberwolves**: The Warriors have traditionally been a strong playoff team, and getting them at +188 on FanDuel could represent value, especially if this is a home game for them (which appears to be the case based on the listing).

3. **Cavaliers vs Pacers**: The total of 229.5/230.5 is quite high for a playoff game. Playoff games typically feature better defense and slower pace. The under might be worth considering.

4. **Thunder vs Nuggets**: A 10.5-point spread is substantial for a playoff matchup, especially between two presumed quality teams. The Nuggets at +10.5 points could be valuable.

## Recommended Bets Considerations

Based on the analysis and limited information, here are potential betting recommendations:

1. **New York Knicks +6.5 (-110) at FanDuel**: Playoff games often tighten up, making this a reasonable spread bet.

2. **Golden State Warriors ML +188 at FanDuel**: If this is indeed a home game for the Warriors, they might have value as significant underdogs.

3. **Under 230.5 (-115) in Cavaliers-Pacers at BetMGM**: High total for a playoff context.

4. **Denver Nuggets +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings or FanDuel**: Large spread for a playoff matchup between quality teams.

5. **Parlay: Knicks +6.5 & Nuggets +10.5**: Combining two underdog spreads that have reasonable value.

Now I'll formalize these into proper recommendations with stake levels based on confidence.

For stake levels:
- 1 unit: Low confidence
- 2 units: Moderate confidence 
- 3 units: Good confidence
- 4 units: High confidence
- 5 units: Highest confidence

Given the limited information, I'll keep stakes conservative (1-3 units).
