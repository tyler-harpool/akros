Let me analyze the live in-game NBA betting data provided for May 12-14, 2025.

First, I need to identify what information I have and what's missing:

1. I have betting odds for moneyline, spread, and totals for all four games.
2. No lineup data is available for any team.
3. No injury information is provided.
4. No actual live game situation/score/stats are provided, which is unusual for a live in-game betting analysis.
5. No statistical edges were identified in the analysis.

Given these constraints, I'll need to analyze based purely on the odds discrepancies between bookmakers and infer what might be happening in the games based on start times and odds movements.

Let's analyze each game:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/12/2025, 11:35:00 PM)

This appears to be a home game for the Knicks, with Boston as the favorite. The spread is 6.5 points in Boston's favor across all bookmakers. Looking at the moneyline, Boston is around -245 to -255, while the Knicks are at +200 to +210.

Totals are set at 208.5 on DraftKings and BetMGM, but 209.5 on FanDuel.

Potential value:
- FanDuel has the most favorable odds for betting on the Knicks at +210
- FanDuel's total is 1 point higher than the others at 209.5, with -112 for the under compared to -105 at BetMGM

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/13/2025, 2:05:00 AM)

This appears to be a home game for the Warriors, with Minnesota as the favorite. The spread is 5.5 points in Minnesota's favor across all bookmakers. The moneyline shows Minnesota around -220 to -225, with the Warriors at +180 to +188.

Totals are set at 199.5 on DraftKings and BetMGM, but 200.5 on FanDuel.

Potential value:
- BetMGM has the best Warriors moneyline at +180
- FanDuel has the most favorable Warriors spread at +5.5 (-108)
- FanDuel offers a slightly higher total at 200.5 with the under at -112

## Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers (5/13/2025, 11:00:00 PM)

This is a home game for the Cavaliers, who are the favorites. The spread is between 6.5 and 7 points in favor of the Cavaliers. Cleveland's moneyline ranges from -255 to -275, with Indiana at +210 to +220.

Totals are set at 229.5 on FanDuel and DraftKings, but 230.5 on BetMGM.

Potential value:
- FanDuel has the best Cavaliers moneyline at -255
- DraftKings and BetMGM offer Pacers +6.5, while FanDuel has +7 (-114)
- BetMGM has a higher total at 230.5 with the under at -115

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/14/2025, 1:35:00 AM)

This is a home game for the Thunder, who are heavy favorites. The spread is 10.5 points across all bookmakers. OKC's moneyline ranges from -460 to -500, with Denver at +360 to +380.

Totals are set at 220.5 on DraftKings and BetMGM, but 221.5 on FanDuel.

Potential value:
- FanDuel has the best Thunder moneyline at -460
- BetMGM offers the most favorable Thunder spread at -10.5 (-105)
- FanDuel has a higher total at 221.5

Without live game data, it's challenging to make strong recommendations for in-game betting. However, I can identify some potential value based on odds discrepancies between bookmakers.

Here are my recommended bets based on the information available:

1. Knicks +6.5 (-105) on DraftKings
   - This line is consistent across bookmakers, but DraftKings offers slightly better odds

2. FanDuel's Under 209.5 (-112) for Knicks vs Celtics
   - FanDuel's total is a point higher than the other books, which provides some value

3. Warriors +5.5 (-108) on FanDuel
   - Best odds available for this spread

4. Pacers +7 (-114) on FanDuel
   - Getting an extra half-point compared to other books

5. Thunder -10.5 (-105) on BetMGM
   - Best odds available for this spread

Let me format these into a proper markdown table for the recommendation.
