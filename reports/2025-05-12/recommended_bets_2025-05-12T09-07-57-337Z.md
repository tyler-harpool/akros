## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +6.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Playoff games typically tighten in scoring margin. Knicks should keep this competitive at home, and this is a favorable spread compared to the -115 at other books. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Warriors | +188 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best underdog value across all games. Warriors at home with playoff experience makes this worth a small play at these odds. |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | This total appears inflated for what's likely a playoff matchup where defensive intensity increases. BetMGM offers the highest total, creating value. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +10.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 3 units | 10.5 points is a significant playoff cushion for an experienced Denver team. Playoff games rarely see blowouts of this magnitude between quality teams. |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best value on this line compared to -110 elsewhere, and FanDuel's +7 line suggests some books see the Pacers as more competitive. |

These recommendations focus on finding value in the odds discrepancies while considering typical playoff basketball patterns. Without specific player information, I've kept stakes moderate, with higher confidence in spread plays where there's clearer value identification.
