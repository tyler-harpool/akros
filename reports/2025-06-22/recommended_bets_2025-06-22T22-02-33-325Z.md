## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 3 | The half-point improvement over other books provides critical value, and Indiana's offensive firepower should keep them competitive even against OKC's strong defense |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 215 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Haliburton-led Pacers play at a fast pace, creating more possessions, while both teams have multiple scoring threats that can exploit defensive mismatches |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +225 (BetMGM) | 1 | Small value play on the Pacers having a ceiling outcome where Haliburton orchestrates an efficient offense that neutralizes OKC's defensive strengths |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -118 (BetMGM) | 2 | Alternative play recognizing Thunder's home-court strength and superior two-way talent led by SGA and Holmgren against a Pacers team that can struggle defensively |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management, particularly since this game is scheduled in the future and team dynamics may change before tipoff.
