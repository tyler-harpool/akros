## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Spread | Pacers +7 | -108 | 2 | If Thunder are leading but by less than pre-game spread, taking Pacers at original line offers value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Moneyline | Thunder | -278 | 3 | If game is closer than expected but Thunder showing control, reduced live ML offers value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Total | Under 214.5 | -110 | 2 | Value if pace is slower than expected but live total hasn't adjusted significantly |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Quarter | Thunder 4Q -2.5 | -110 | 1 | Thunder likely to close strong at home if game remains competitive |

Note: Since this is live betting analysis without current game state information, these recommendations are based on potential scenarios that might present value. Adjust based on the actual game situation, and always consider how the current game dynamics compare to pre-game expectations.
