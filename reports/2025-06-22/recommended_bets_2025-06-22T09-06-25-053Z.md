## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs. Pacers | Spread | Thunder -7 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 | Thunder's elite defense and scoring from SGA should allow them to control the game at home and win by margin |
| Thunder vs. Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Thunder's defensive length and ability to control pace should limit the Pacers' transition opportunities |
| Thunder vs. Pacers | Spread | Pacers +7.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | Extra half-point provides crucial value; Pacers' offensive firepower keeps them competitive even in a loss |
| Thunder vs. Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +240 (BetMGM) | 1 | Small-value play on upset potential if Haliburton dictates pace and Pacers' offense clicks from perimeter |

The strongest play appears to be on the total under 214.5, as the Thunder should be able to impose their defensive will and control the tempo of this game. While I like the Thunder to cover, the extra half-point on the Pacers spread at BetMGM provides insurance against a potential 7-point Thunder victory.
