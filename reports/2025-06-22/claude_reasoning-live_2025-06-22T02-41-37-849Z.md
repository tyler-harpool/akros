Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities for Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers. I'll need to work with somewhat limited information since there's no lineup data, injury information, or edge analysis provided.

First, let's examine the available betting lines:

### Moneyline Odds
- OKC Thunder (Home): -290 (FanDuel), -278 (DraftKings), -300 (BetMGM)
- Indiana Pacers (Away): 235 (FanDuel), 225 (DraftKings), 240 (BetMGM)

This shows OKC as a significant favorite, with implied probabilities around 73-75%.

### Spread Odds
- OKC Thunder: -7 (-112) FanDuel, -7.5 (-108) DraftKings, -7.5 (-105) BetMGM
- Indiana Pacers: +7 (-108) FanDuel, +7.5 (-112) DraftKings, +7.5 (-115) BetMGM

The consensus spread is around 7-7.5 points in favor of OKC.

### Totals (Over/Under)
All bookmakers have set the total at 214.5 points, with odds near even.

Now, this is a live in-game betting analysis, but I don't have information about the current game state, score, or what quarter/time remains. This makes it challenging to provide specific live betting recommendations. Normally, I'd want to know:

1. Current score
2. Time remaining
3. Current momentum
4. Any significant in-game injuries
5. Foul trouble for key players
6. Shooting performance so far

Without this information, I'll need to make some general observations and recommendations based on the betting lines provided.

The fact that OKC is a 7-7.5 point favorite with a moderate total of 214.5 suggests this is expected to be a controlled game where OKC has a clear advantage. The Thunder are likely favored due to home court advantage and potentially having better overall team quality.

For live betting, I'll need to consider potential scenarios and provide recommendations based on general basketball principles and value identification:

1. If OKC is leading comfortably (by 10+ points), the live spread might increase. In this case, Indiana could represent value if they've shown signs of making runs.

2. If the game is closer than expected, backing OKC at a reduced spread might offer value.

3. For totals, if the pace has been slower than expected, an under might be valuable, especially if the live total hasn't adjusted much.

4. If certain star players are performing well above their averages, there might be regression to the mean, suggesting value on the opposing team.

5. If free throw rates are unusually high/low so far, this could inform totals betting.

Without specific in-game information, my recommendations will be somewhat hypothetical, but I'll structure them in a way that's most helpful for live betting decisions.

Let me prepare my recommended bets based on the information available:
