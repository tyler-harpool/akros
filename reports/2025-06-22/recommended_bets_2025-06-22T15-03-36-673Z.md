## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -105 | 3 | The half-point hook provides significant value over the standard +7 offered elsewhere. Indiana's offensive firepower should keep them within striking distance. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -105 | 3 | OKC's defensive identity should slow the pace, and BetMGM offers the best price on this total. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +240 | 1 | While OKC should win, the Pacers have enough talent for a potential upset at valuable +240 odds. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -3.5 | -170 | 2 | A safer alternative to the moneyline that still provides value if OKC wins but doesn't cover the full spread. |

Note: The Alt Spread odds were estimated based on standard market pricing - confirm exact odds with your bookmaker before placing this bet.
