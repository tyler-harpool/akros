## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -7 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other books (-7 vs -7.5) provides significant edge that outweighs the slightly worse odds |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +240 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | Best underdog value available; BetMGM offers highest payout if Pacers can pull off upset |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -278 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best favorite value available; 22 points better than BetMGM's -300 line |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Slightly better odds than competitors offering the same total; strong value if game shows defensive trends |

Note: Without specific in-game information about current score, time remaining, pace, and team performance, these recommendations focus on identifying the best available prices in the current marketplace. Adjust stakes based on how the game is actually unfolding.
