I need to analyze the available NBA betting information for the game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. The game is set for Monday, June 23, 2025, at 12:00 AM. Let me systematically work through the information provided and develop betting recommendations.

## Basic Game Information
- **Home Team**: Oklahoma City Thunder
- **Away Team**: Indiana Pacers
- **Date/Time**: June 23, 2025, 12:00:00 AM

## Current Betting Lines

### Moneyline Odds
- Thunder: -290 (FanDuel), -278 (DraftKings), -300 (BetMGM)
- Pacers: +235 (FanDuel), +225 (DraftKings), +240 (BetMGM)

Implied probabilities for Thunder winning:
- FanDuel: -290 → ~74.4% 
- DraftKings: -278 → ~73.5%
- BetMGM: -300 → ~75.0%

Implied probabilities for Pacers winning:
- FanDuel: +235 → ~29.9%
- DraftKings: +225 → ~30.8%
- BetMGM: +240 → ~29.4%

### Spread Odds
- Thunder: -7 (-114) [FanDuel], -7.5 (-108) [DraftKings], -7.5 (-105) [BetMGM]
- Pacers: +7 (-106) [FanDuel], +7.5 (-112) [DraftKings], +7.5 (-115) [BetMGM]

### Totals (Over/Under)
- All bookmakers have the total at 214.5 points
- Odds range from -112 to -108 for both over and under

## Missing Information
I notice there's no information about:
- Current score and game state (quarter, time remaining)
- Team lineups and injury reports
- Recent performance statistics
- In-game statistics (shooting percentages, rebounds, etc.)

Since this is a live in-game betting analysis, I'm missing crucial information about the current state of the game, which makes it difficult to provide precise recommendations.

## What We Know
The Thunder are significant favorites (-290 to -300 moneyline, -7 to -7.5 spread), suggesting they are the stronger team in this matchup. The total is set at 214.5 points, which is a moderate total for an NBA game.

Given that this is presented as a live in-game betting analysis, I need to carefully consider what recommendations to make with limited information. 

## Potential Betting Angles

1. **Moneyline Comparison**: BetMGM offers the best value for a Pacers bet at +240, while DraftKings offers slightly better value for a Thunder bet at -278.

2. **Spread Comparison**: FanDuel offers the best value for a Thunder bet at -7 (-114), which is half a point better than the other books, though at slightly worse odds. For the Pacers, FanDuel again offers +7 (-106), which is half a point better than other books.

3. **Totals Comparison**: FanDuel offers slightly better odds on the Under at -108, while odds are generally balanced across bookmakers.

Given the limited information about the current game state, I'll need to craft recommendations that account for various possible scenarios. I'll focus on identifying the best values among the different bookmakers for each potential betting angle.

Let me prepare my recommendations:

## RECOMMENDED BETS

1. **Value on Pacers Spread**: FanDuel offers Pacers +7 at -106, which is better than the +7.5 at other books. If the game is close or the Pacers are showing competitive play, this could be valuable.

2. **Best Moneyline Value for Underdog**: BetMGM offers Pacers at +240, the best available price. For a high-risk, high-reward play if the Pacers are showing promise in the game.

3. **Best Total Under Value**: FanDuel offers Under 214.5 at -108, slightly better than other books. This could be valuable if the game is showing defensive tendencies.

4. **Best Thunder Spread Value**: FanDuel offers Thunder -7 at -114, half a point better than other books. If the Thunder are in control, this offers a better line than competitors.

5. **Best Thunder Moneyline Value**: DraftKings offers Thunder at -278, better than the -290 and -300 at other books. For a safer play if the Thunder are clearly in control.

Now let me assign stakes based on the limited information available and format these as required. Since I don't have specific in-game information, I'll keep stakes more conservative (1-3 units):
