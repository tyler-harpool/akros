## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Better value than DraftKings' -110 for the same spread; 9 points provides significant cushion in what could be a competitive game |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's 230.5 at nearly identical juice; provides winning position if game lands exactly on 230 |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +315 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best available odds for an upset with 15-point advantage over DraftKings; small stake acknowledges risk but captures value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points Middle | Over 230 (DK)/Under 230.5 (FD) | -112/-108 | 2 units | Strategic opportunity to win both bets if game lands exactly on 230 points; limited risk with reasonable combined juice |

These recommendations prioritize line shopping advantages and strategic positioning rather than team-specific factors due to the limited contextual information available. As lineup information and injury reports become available closer to game time, these recommendations should be reevaluated.
