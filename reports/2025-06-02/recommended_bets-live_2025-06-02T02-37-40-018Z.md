# NBA LIVE BETTING Betting Recommendations

## RECOMMENDED BETS
Since this appears to be pre-game rather than live betting data, I can only offer limited recommendations based on the information provided:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -115 (DK) | 2 | Large spreads often provide value for underdogs, especially with no lineup information to justify such a wide margin |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Under 230.5 | -108 (FD) | 2 | Slightly better odds on FanDuel for the under, and playoff-type games often play tighter defense |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 (DK) | 1 | Small value play on significant underdog with slightly better odds on DraftKings |

For more accurate live betting recommendations, I would need current game state information including score, time remaining, and in-game performance metrics.
