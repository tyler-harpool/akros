## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 | Better pricing than Thunder side (-115), indicating slight market preference for underdogs at this number |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals Middle | Over 230.5 (DraftKings) | -112 | 1 | Potential middle opportunity if game lands exactly at 231 points |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals Middle | Under 231.5 (FanDuel) | -112 | 1 | Paired with above bet to create middle opportunity |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 230.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 3 | If leaning to a high-scoring game, this represents the better value between available options |

This analysis is limited by the lack of team data, but focuses on mathematical advantages in the current betting markets. The recommended bets leverage price discrepancies between sportsbooks and potential middle opportunities that exist regardless of team performance factors.
