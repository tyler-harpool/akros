## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | FanDuel offers the best value on the underdog spread with the lowest vig; 9 points provides solid cushion in what could be a more competitive game than odds suggest |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | The slight odds advantage favors the under; high totals often represent ceiling projections that leave room for defensive adjustments |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +320 (DraftKings) | 1 | While Oklahoma City is rightfully favored, DraftKings offers the best payout on a potential upset; small-stake opportunity given the +320 represents value against implied 23.8% win probability |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -4.5 | -200 (DraftKings) | 3 | Buying down the spread increases win probability while maintaining reasonable odds; captures scenarios where Thunder win by 5-8 points |

Note: These recommendations are made with moderate confidence given the limited information available. Monitoring lineup news and injury reports closer to game time would be advisable before finalizing wagers.
