## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC Thunder vs Denver Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +9.5 | -105 | 3 units | Jokic-led Nuggets typically keep games competitive, and this spread overvalues the Thunder despite Denver's championship pedigree. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers | Total | Over 231.5 | -110 | 3 units | Pacers' uptempo style combined with both teams' offensive firepower should produce a high-scoring affair with both teams at full strength. |
| Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks | Total | Under 208.5 | -112 | 3 units | Both teams emphasize defensive intensity, especially in meaningful late-season matchups, leading to slower possessions and contested shots. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors | Spread | Warriors +11.5 | -115 | 2 units | Without specific injury information, this spread appears excessive against a Warriors team that typically remains competitive even in adverse situations. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers | Spread | Pacers +8 | -115 | 2 units | Haliburton's playmaking and Indiana's offensive weapons should keep them within striking distance against Cleveland. |
