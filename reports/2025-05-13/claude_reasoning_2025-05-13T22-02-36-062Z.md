Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities for Tuesday, May 13, 2025, by looking at each game systematically.

## Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers

**Odds Analysis:**
- Moneyline: Cavaliers heavily favored (-290 to -325 range)
- Spread: Cavaliers favored by 8-8.5 points
- Total: 231-231.5 points

**Team Context:**
- Cavaliers have a strong lineup with Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, and Allen - a good mix of offensive firepower and defensive presence
- Pacers have Haliburton and Siakam as their key players, with Turner providing rim protection
- The Pacers are known for playing at a faster pace, which could contribute to the high total

**Considerations:**
- No injury information provided, but the lineups appear complete
- Cavaliers typically have a strong home court advantage
- The 8-8.5 point spread is significant, suggesting bookmakers see the Cavaliers as clearly superior

**Potential Value:**
- The total of 231.5 seems high but realistic given the Pacers' uptempo style and the offensive capabilities of both teams
- The best spread value appears to be with DraftKings at -8 (-105) if backing the Cavaliers

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

**Odds Analysis:**
- Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-440 to -460 range)
- Spread: Thunder favored by 9.5-10 points

- Nuggets have the reigning MVP Jokic, Murray, and solid role players
- This matchup features two Western Conference powerhouses

**Considerations:**
- No key injuries noted
- Thunder being favored by 10 points over the Nuggets is significant, suggesting there may be context I'm missing (like Nuggets on a back-to-back or accumulated fatigue)
- The Nuggets with Jokic are typically competitive against any team

**Potential Value:**
- BetMGM offers Nuggets +9.5 (-105), which seems like potential value given the Nuggets' competitive nature
- The total at BetMGM (220.5) has the Under priced at -105, which might present value

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

**Odds Analysis:**
- Moneyline: Celtics moderately favored (-185 to -190 range)
- Spread: Celtics favored by 4.5 points across all bookmakers
- Total: 207.5-208.5 points

**Team Context:**
- No lineup information provided for either team
- Both are Eastern Conference teams with strong defenses historically
- The lower total suggests bookmakers expect a defensive struggle

**Considerations:**

- Spread: Timberwolves favored by 11.5 points
- Total: 203.5-204 points

**Team Context:**
- No lineup information provided
- The Warriors are historically a high-scoring team, while the Timberwolves have been defense-oriented
- The low total suggests the Timberwolves' defensive identity may be dominating the matchup

**Considerations:**
- Without lineup information, we're missing key context
- The heavy spread suggests Golden State might be depleted or struggling
- The low total (203.5-204) is atypical for Warriors games traditionally

**Potential Value:**
- Warriors +11.5 at BetMGM (-115) could be worth considering if there's no major injury information missing
- DraftKings has the Over at 203.5 (-108) which might be value if the Warriors can generate enough offense

Now, let me identify the most promising betting opportunities across these games:

1. **Nuggets +9.5 (-105) at BetMGM**: The Nuggets with Jokic typically keep games competitive, and this seems like a large spread for a team of their caliber.

2. **Warriors +11.5 (-115) at BetMGM**: Without knowing specific injury information, this spread seems large for a Warriors team that has historically been competitive.

3. **Cavaliers-Pacers Over 231.5 (-110) at DraftKings/BetMGM**: Both teams have offensive firepower, and the Pacers typically play at a fast pace which could drive a high-scoring affair.

4. **Celtics-Knicks Under 208.5 (-112) at FanDuel**: Both teams have strong defensive identities historically, and playoff-type basketball in May tends to be more defensive-oriented.

5. **Pacers +8 (-115) at DraftKings**: The Pacers have enough offensive weapons to potentially keep this game competitive, especially if Haliburton is playing well.

Considering the limited information and the odds presented, these seem like the most reasonable options. Without additional injury information or recent performance metrics, my confidence level for all of these bets would be moderate (around 3 units out of 5).

Let me assemble these into the recommended bets table:

RECOMMENDED BETS:
1. Denver Nuggets +9.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 3 units - The Nuggets with Jokic typically keep games competitive against any opponent
2. Warriors +11.5 (-115) at BetMGM - 2 units - This spread seems large without specific injury information
3. Cavaliers-Pacers Over 231.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 3 units - Both teams have offensive firepower and Pacers play at a fast pace
4. Celtics-Knicks Under 208.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 3 units - Both teams have strong defensive identities
5. Pacers +8 (-115) at DraftKings - 2 units - Pacers have offensive weapons to keep the game competitive

Wait, I should double-check some details:

1. For the Thunder vs Nuggets game, the Thunder are the home team according to the data provided, and they're favored. This suggests they might be having a strong season or the Nuggets are struggling, which explains the large spread.

2. For the Timberwolves vs Warriors game, the Timberwolves are the home team and heavily favored. 

Let me correct my analysis based on this clarification:

1. **Nuggets +9.5 (-105) at BetMGM**: The Thunder are favored by 9.5 points at home over the Nuggets. Given that the Nuggets have Jokic, Murray, and a solid roster, this spread seems large. Nuggets teams with Jokic typically remain competitive.

2. **Warriors +11.5 (-115) at BetMGM**: The Timberwolves are favored by 11.5 points at home. Without specific injury information, this seems like a large spread against a Warriors team.

3. **Cavaliers-Pacers Over 231.5 (-110) at DraftKings/BetMGM**: The analysis remains valid - both teams have offensive capability and the Pacers play at a faster pace.

4. **Celtics-Knicks Under 208.5 (-112) at FanDuel**: The analysis remains valid - both teams typically play strong defense, especially in important late-season matchups.

5. **Pacers +8 (-115) at DraftKings**: The Cavaliers are favored by 8 points at home. The Pacers with Haliburton, Siakam, and Turner have enough talent to potentially keep this game closer.

With these clarifications, I'll finalize my recommendations:

RECOMMENDED BETS:
1. Denver Nuggets +9.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 3 units
2. Golden State Warriors +11.5 (-115) at BetMGM - 2 units
3. Cavaliers-Pacers Over 231.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 3 units
4. Celtics-Knicks Under 208.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 3 units
5. Pacers +8 (-115) at DraftKings - 2 units

Wait, I see one discrepancy in my analysis. When listing the lineups, the Nuggets @ Thunder indicating the Nuggets are away, but in the odds section it shows "Home Team" for the Thunder. Let me check the original data:

In the "Available NBA Betting Lines" section, under "Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets":
- The moneyline, spread, and total odds all list the Thunder first, indicating they're the home team
- The home team column has odds like -440, -10, etc., which would be typical for the favored home team

However, under "Current Team Lineups", it shows "Denver Nuggets @ Oklahoma City Thunder", which indicates the Nuggets are visiting the Thunder.

This is consistent, so the Thunder are the home team and the Nuggets are the away team. The Thunder are heavily favored at home, and I'll stick with my analysis that the Nuggets +9.5 points could have value given their typical competitiveness with Jokic.

Similarly, for "Golden State Warriors @ Minnesota Timberwolves", the Warriors are the away team and the Timberwolves are the home team, which is consistent with the odds presentation.

Let me double-check my other games:

For "Indiana Pacers @ Cleveland Cavaliers", the Pacers are away and the Cavaliers are home, consistent with the odds.

For "New York Knicks @ Boston Celtics", the Knicks are away and the Celtics are home, consistent with the odds.

With these clarifications, my recommendations remain valid:

RECOMMENDED BETS:
1. Denver Nuggets +9.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 3 units - Nuggets with Jokic typically remain competitive
2. Golden State Warriors +11.5 (-115) at BetMGM - 2 units - Large spread without knowing specific injuries
3. Cavaliers-Pacers Over 231.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 3 units - Fast-paced game with offensive firepower
4. Celtics-Knicks Under 208.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 3 units - Defensive-minded teams in a potential playoff atmosphere
5. Pacers +8 (-115) at DraftKings - 2 units - Pacers have enough talent to keep the game competitive
