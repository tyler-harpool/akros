Let me analyze these NBA betting opportunities comprehensively. I'll examine each game in detail, considering the matchups, lineups, and betting odds to identify potential value.

## Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers

**Game Start**: 5/13/2025, 11:00:00 PM

**Betting Lines**:
- **Moneyline**: Cavaliers are heavy favorites (-290 to -325)
- **Spread**: Cavaliers favored by 8-8.5 points
- **Total**: 231-231.5 points

**Lineup Analysis**:
The Cavaliers have a strong starting five with Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Max Strus, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen. This is a well-balanced lineup with scoring (Mitchell, Garland), defense (Mobley, Allen), and shooting (Strus).

The Pacers feature Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, Myles Turner, Aaron Nesmith, and Andrew Nembhard. This is a good offensive team with Haliburton's playmaking and Siakam's scoring, plus Turner's ability to stretch the floor.

The Cavaliers have a significant advantage in interior defense with Mobley and Allen, which could make it difficult for the Pacers to score inside. However, the Pacers play at a faster pace and could push the tempo to generate offense.

**Betting Analysis**:
- The 8-8.5 point spread seems reasonable given the Cavaliers' home-court advantage and defensive strength.
- The total of 231-231.5 is interesting. The Pacers typically play at a high pace which could push the total higher, but the Cavaliers' defense might slow things down.
- DraftKings offers the best value on the Cavaliers spread at -8 (-105).
- For totals, FanDuel offers 231 which is slightly lower than other books at 231.5.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

**Game Start**: 5/14/2025, 1:35:00 AM

**Betting Lines**:
- **Moneyline**: Thunder are heavy favorites (-440 to -450)
- **Spread**: Thunder favored by 9.5-10 points
- **Total**: 220.5-221.5 points

**Lineup Analysis**:
The Thunder feature SGA, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, and Hartenstein. This is a balanced lineup with elite scoring (SGA), defensive prowess (Dort), and interior presence (Holmgren, Hartenstein).

The Nuggets have Murray, Braun, Porter Jr., Gordon, and Jokic. They have the reigning MVP in Jokic and a strong supporting cast, but they appear to be road underdogs here.

**Betting Analysis**:
- The Thunder being 10-point favorites over the Nuggets is significant. This suggests the Thunder are a superior team or the Nuggets might be dealing with undisclosed issues.
- BetMGM offers the best value on the Nuggets spread at +9.5 (-105) if you like the underdog.
- The total of 220.5-221.5 seems reasonable for these teams. BetMGM offers the lowest total at 220.5.

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

**Game Start**: 5/14/2025, 11:05:00 PM

**Betting Lines**:
- **Moneyline**: Celtics are moderate favorites (-185 to -190)
- **Spread**: Celtics favored by 4.5 points
- **Total**: 207.5-208.5 points

**Lineup Analysis**:
No lineup data is available for either team, which makes analysis more challenging.

**Betting Analysis**:
- The 4.5-point spread suggests a competitive game.
- DraftKings offers the best value on the Celtics spread at -4.5 (-108).
- For totals, there's a slight discrepancy with FanDuel offering 208.5 while others have 207.5. This could create an arbitrage opportunity.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

**Game Start**: 5/15/2025, 1:35:00 AM

**Betting Lines**:
- **Moneyline**: Timberwolves are heavy favorites (-600 to -650)
- **Spread**: Timberwolves favored by 11.5 points
- **Total**: 203.5-204 points

**Lineup Analysis**:
No lineup data is available for either team, which makes analysis more challenging.

**Betting Analysis**:
- The 11.5-point spread is significant and suggests the Warriors may be outmatched or potentially resting key players.
- All bookmakers have the same spread, but BetMGM offers the best value at -11.5 (-105) for the Timberwolves.
- The total is quite low at 203.5-204, suggesting a defensive battle or slower pace.

Now, let me identify the best betting opportunities across these games:
