## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +9.5 | -105 | 4 units | Denver's championship experience and Jokic's elite playmaking should keep this game closer than 10 points. BetMGM offers the best line at +9.5 compared to +10 elsewhere. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Total | Under 208.5 | -112 | 3 units | Eastern Conference playoff matchups typically feature increased defensive intensity. These teams have historically played grinding, physical games in the playoffs. FanDuel offers the highest total for maximum value. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Warriors +11.5 | -112 | 3 units | An 11.5-point spread is excessive for a playoff game involving the experienced Warriors, who have championship pedigree and typically perform well in high-stakes games. |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +12.5 | -128 | 2 units | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Double-digit playoff spreads often provide value to underdogs, as teams tend to play with increased focus when trailing. Pacers have enough offensive firepower to potentially cut into any large lead. |

Remember that live betting recommendations require careful timing, as odds shift rapidly based on game events. For upcoming games, consider line movement as game time approaches and monitor injury reports for any late changes.
