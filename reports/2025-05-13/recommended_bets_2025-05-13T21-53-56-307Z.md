## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets @ Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +9.5 | -105 | 3 | Jokic-led teams rarely get this many points; Denver has the offensive firepower to keep it competitive even on the road. BetMGM offers the best value at +9.5. |
| Pacers @ Cavaliers | Total | Over 231 | -112 | 3 | Pacers play at a high pace and have offensive firepower with Haliburton and Siakam. FanDuel offers the lowest total number, providing slightly better value. |
| Knicks @ Celtics | Total | Under 208.5 | -112 | 2 | Both teams typically play tough defense in important matchups. FanDuel offers the highest total among books, creating value on the under. |
| Warriors @ Timberwolves | Total | Under 204 | -110 | 2 | The low total suggests a defensive battle. Minnesota has elite defenders while Golden State may struggle to score consistently against this defense. |
| Knicks @ Celtics | Spread | Celtics -4.5 | -108 | 2 | Boston performs well at home and DraftKings offers the best price. The Celtics' home court advantage should be worth more than 4.5 points against the Knicks. |
