# NBA Playoff Betting Analysis

After analyzing the provided betting opportunities, I'll focus on identifying value based on statistical edges, injury impacts, and playoff context. Let's examine each game in the current playoff environment.

## Game Analysis

### Knicks vs Celtics (Knicks lead 2-0)
The betting market has the Celtics as massive 14.5-point favorites despite being down 0-2 in the series. This suggests strong market expectation for a significant Boston home bounce-back performance. The detected edge on the Knicks moneyline at +800 is interesting, as the model indicates a 4.29% edge with positive expected value. This large line movement implies either the market believes the Celtics will dominate or there are undisclosed injury concerns for New York.

### Warriors vs Timberwolves (Series tied 1-1)
Stephen Curry's absence with a hamstring injury dramatically changes this matchup. The Warriors offense revolves around Curry's gravity, shooting and playmaking. Without him, Minnesota's elite defense should have a significant advantage. The 5.5-point spread may not fully account for Curry's absence, especially considering Minnesota's defensive capabilities and overall team strength.

### Nuggets vs Thunder (Series tied 1-1)
The defending champion Nuggets are 6-point underdogs at Oklahoma City. Neither team has significant injury concerns at the moment. Denver has proven playoff experience and the best player in the series with Nikola Jokić, while OKC's young squad has home court advantage. This line suggests the market strongly values Thunder's home court and the momentum shift after they evened the series.

### Pacers vs Cavaliers (Pacers lead 2-1)
Despite the Pacers leading the series 2-1, they're 5-point underdogs in Cleveland. Both teams have been scoring effectively in this series, with the total set at a high 231 points. This reflects both teams' offensive capabilities and the faster pace the Pacers prefer to play at.

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +14.5 | -110 | 3 | Despite being down 0-2, a 14.5-point spread for Boston is excessive. Knicks have proven they can compete, and playoff games typically tighten in must-win scenarios. Series trends favor taking the points. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Timberwolves | -218 | 4 | Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense. Minnesota's elite defense should capitalize, and the Wolves showed dominance in Game 1. This price is justified given the star player absence. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6 | -115 | 2 | Defending champions with Jokić are dangerous even on the road. Denver has demonstrated resilience and playoff experience. Six points provides cushion against a Thunder team still gaining playoff experience. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Over 231 | -110 | 2 | Both teams have shown offensive firepower in this series. Pacers play at one of the fastest paces in the league (3rd), while Cavs will push tempo at home facing a must-win situation down 2-1. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | H2H | Knicks | 800 | 1 | Model shows 4.29% edge with positive expected value. While a straight upset is less likely than covering the spread, the 8-to-1 payout offers value for a team that's already won twice in this series. |

Remember to verify all injury statuses before placing these bets, as playoff injury reporting can change rapidly and significantly impact these recommendations.

## Player Props Analysis

Player props often present the biggest market inefficiencies. Consider these factors when analyzing player props:

1. **Minutes projection** - The foundation of all player prop analysis
2. **Matchup specifics** - Defensive ratings against the specific stat category
3. **Recent role changes** - Lineup adjustments in playoff series
4. **Pace impact** - How game tempo affects counting stats
