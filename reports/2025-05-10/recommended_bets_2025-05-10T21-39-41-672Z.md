## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total Points | Under 220.5 | -110 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: With Boston's large lead, expect bench players to see significant minutes in the closing period, slowing the pace and limiting scoring opportunities. BetMGM offers the highest total for maximum value. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total Points | Under 200.5 | -110 | 4 | Minnesota boasts an elite defense that has consistently kept games under totals. Warriors will struggle to generate efficient offense against Minnesota's length and defensive discipline. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best value at +6.5. Denver's championship experience and playoff resilience make them dangerous underdogs, capable of keeping this game close even on the road. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Cavaliers -4.5 | -112 | 3 | DraftKings offers the best value with the lowest spread. Cleveland's defensive identity should contain Indiana's fast-paced offense, while their methodical approach will exploit mismatches against the Pacers' weaker defense. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total Points | Under 231 | -110 | 2 | Cleveland's defensive approach will slow Indiana's preferred pace. While the Pacers want to run, the Cavaliers excel at forcing opponents into half-court sets, likely keeping this game under the total. |

Remember that live betting recommendations require quick action as odds can shift rapidly based on game events.
