Let me analyze the betting opportunities based on the provided information, focusing on statistical edges, injury impacts, and playoff context. I'll then provide concrete bet recommendations.

First, let's look at the detected edge:

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Market: H2H (Moneyline)
- Selection: New York Knicks
- Best Odds: 1400 (or +1400 in American odds)
- Edge: 4.29%
- Expected Value: 0.6441
- Projected CLV: 1.00%

This suggests there's value in betting on the Knicks moneyline at +1400 odds. The model has detected a 4.29% edge, with a positive expected value. The CLV (Closing Line Value) projection suggests the line might move in our favor.

Now, let's analyze each game considering injuries and playoff context:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Current Series: Knicks lead 2-0
- Key Injuries: Sam Hauser (Celtics) is out with an ankle injury

The Knicks have a surprising 2-0 lead in the series. The fact that the Knicks are 14.5-point underdogs despite leading the series 2-0 is notable. This suggests either significant injury developments for the Knicks not mentioned in the injury report, or the market strongly believes Boston will bounce back at home.

Looking at the moneyline odds (+800 for Knicks, -1600 for Celtics), there's a significant discrepancy. The identified edge on the Knicks moneyline at +1400 is substantial, but we need to be cautious since the actual odds shown are +800, not +1400. There may be updated information not reflected in our analysis.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Current Series: Tied 1-1
- Key Injuries: Stephen Curry (Warriors) is out with a hamstring injury, Rob Dillingham (Timberwolves) is out

Curry's absence is massive for the Warriors. He's their offensive engine, and without him, their offensive efficiency and spacing will suffer significantly. This creates value on the Timberwolves side, who are favored at -218 with the Warriors getting 5.5 points on the spread.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Current Series: Tied 1-1
- Key Injuries: No significant current injuries for either team

This series is tied 1-1 with the Thunder favored at -225 and the Nuggets getting 6 points. This suggests the game is in Oklahoma City. With no major injuries, this comes down to matchup analysis and series trends.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Current Series: Pacers lead 2-1
- Key Injuries: Isaiah Jackson (Pacers) is out

The Pacers have a 2-1 lead but are 5-point underdogs, suggesting the game is in Cleveland. The Cavaliers are favored at -205 on the moneyline.

Now, let's analyze the best betting opportunities:

1. **New York Knicks +14.5 (-110) or Moneyline (+800)**
   The Knicks are up 2-0 in the series, yet are massive underdogs. While Boston at home will likely play better, 14.5 points seems excessive for a team that's proven they can compete with and beat the Celtics. The model found an edge on the Knicks moneyline, though at different odds than listed.

2. **Minnesota Timberwolves -5.5 (-110) vs Warriors**
   With Curry out, the Warriors will struggle offensively. The Timberwolves have a strong defense and should be able to take advantage of Curry's absence. The line at -5.5 may not fully account for the impact of losing a superstar of Curry's caliber.

3. **Denver Nuggets +6 (-115) vs Thunder**
   The Nuggets are the defending champions with playoff experience. While OKC has home court, Denver has shown resilience in playoffs, and Jokic's presence always gives them a chance. Getting 6 points with the defending champs seems like potential value.

4. **Cleveland/Indiana Over 231 (-110)**
   Both teams have shown they can score in this series, and the Pacers play at one of the fastest paces in the league. This could lead to a high-scoring affair, especially if the Cavaliers look to bounce back after falling behind in the series.

One thing to note is that there seems to be a discrepancy between the identified edge (Knicks at +1400) and the actual odds listed (+800). I'll need to be careful about this in my recommendations.

Based on my analysis, here are the concrete betting recommendations:
