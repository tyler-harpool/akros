## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Minnesota's elite defense should contain Golden State, and this matchup projects to be a slower-paced, half-court battle with the Wolves controlling tempo. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 4 | Strong value on the defending champions at home with playoff experience. Denver rarely gets this many points at home, and their championship pedigree suggests they'll keep this competitive. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best line available among bookmakers. Indiana's home-court advantage combined with their fast-paced style should keep this game within the spread, especially with the 5.5-point cushion. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 218.5 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: With Boston holding a large lead, expect slower pace, bench players, and reduced scoring in garbage time as both teams preserve energy for future games. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Over 230.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 | Indiana's up-tempo style will push the pace at home, and both teams have enough offensive firepower to reach this total. Cleveland has shown they can adapt to faster games when necessary. |

Remember that the live betting recommendation for the Knicks-Celtics game requires quick action as odds will continue to adjust throughout the game.
