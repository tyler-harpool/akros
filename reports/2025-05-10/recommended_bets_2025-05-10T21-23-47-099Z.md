## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | The consistent low total across bookmakers suggests defensive focus from both teams. BetMGM offers the best price on what appears to be a grinding playoff battle. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder +6.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 | Getting the extra half-point at +6.5 provides critical value in what should be a competitive playoff game. The Thunder's athleticism should keep this within two possessions. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Taking the largest available spread gives Indiana significant cushion in what should be a high-scoring, back-and-forth affair. Their pace and scoring ability should keep this competitive. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +25.5 | +102 (FanDuel) | 1 | While Boston will likely win easily, this massive spread creates garbage time opportunities for New York to cover. FanDuel offers the best line and positive odds for this extreme underdog scenario. |

These selections aim to capitalize on the line discrepancies between bookmakers while accounting for the expected game dynamics in each matchup. The stake sizes reflect confidence levels based on the consistency of the lines and projected game flow.
