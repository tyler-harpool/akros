Let me analyze the betting opportunities for NBA games on May 10-11, 2025.

## Game 1: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- The spread here is extremely large (18.5-21.5 points depending on the bookmaker)
- Moneyline odds heavily favor Boston (-6500 to -20000)
- This suggests a completely lopsided matchup where Boston is expected to dominate

The huge spread and moneyline discrepancy suggest this might be:
1. A playoff elimination game where Boston is up 3-0 and New York may be demoralized
2. New York might be resting starters
3. New York could have significant injuries

With spreads this large, there's usually value on the underdog as NBA games rarely end with 20+ point differentials unless there are extreme circumstances. However, without knowing the exact context (playoff series status, injuries beyond Curry), it's hard to make a confident recommendation.

## Game 2: Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Minnesota is favored by 5.5 points consistently across all bookmakers
- Moneyline has Minnesota around -225 to -230
- The total points line is set at 200.5, suggesting a defensive-oriented game
- Stephen Curry is out with a hamstring strain until May 13

The Curry injury is significant - he's Golden State's best player and offensive engine. His absence likely explains why Minnesota is favored by 5.5 points. The low total (200.5) suggests oddsmakers expect a slower-paced, defensive game without Curry's offensive production.

Potential edge: Given Curry's absence, Minnesota's spread of -5.5 might actually be value. Golden State will struggle to score without their primary creator.

## Game 3: Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Thunder favored by 6-6.5 points 
- Moneyline has Thunder around -225 to -255
- Total set at 227-227.5 points, suggesting a higher-scoring game

This is interesting because Denver is normally a strong team with Jokić. The fact that OKC is favored by 6+ points suggests either:
1. Denver is likely resting players
2. This is a playoff situation where OKC has momentum
3. Denver has undisclosed injuries

The total is higher than the Warriors-Timberwolves game, indicating oddsmakers expect a faster pace and more scoring.

## Game 4: Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Cleveland favored by 4.5-5.5 points depending on bookmaker
- Moneyline has Cleveland at around -192 to -210
- High total of 230.5-231 points

This projects to be a high-scoring game with Cleveland as moderate favorites. The spread discrepancy between bookmakers (4.5 on DraftKings vs 5.5 on BetMGM) might present an arbitrage opportunity.

The high total suggests both teams play at a fast pace with good offense but potentially weaker defense.

Now let's analyze where the value lies in these games:

### New York vs Boston
Without additional context, it's hard to determine value, but spreads this large usually favor the underdog. The total at 219.5 seems reasonable, but there's no strong indication of value.

### Golden State vs Minnesota
With Curry out, Minnesota -5.5 looks like potential value. The total of 200.5 seems appropriate given Curry's absence will impact Golden State's scoring.

### Denver vs Oklahoma City
The Thunder being favored by 6-6.5 points over a Jokić-led Nuggets team is significant. BetMGM offers the best value for OKC at -6.5 (-105).

### Indiana vs Cleveland
The spread variance between bookmakers suggests line shopping. DraftKings offers Cleveland -4.5 (-112), which is better than BetMGM's -5.5 (-105).

For totals, both books offer 230.5 with BetMGM having slightly better odds on the over at -115.

Based on this analysis, here are my recommended bets:

1. Minnesota Timberwolves -5.5 (-110) vs Golden State Warriors - Curry's absence is massive for Golden State's offense
2. Oklahoma City Thunder -6 (-115) vs Denver Nuggets - Strong value unless there's context I'm missing about Denver
3. Cleveland Cavaliers -4.5 (-112) vs Indiana Pacers - Best spread value among bookmakers
4. Indiana vs Cleveland OVER 230.5 (-115) - Both teams play at high pace

Let me review for any missing considerations:

1. The Knicks-Celtics game has an extremely large spread, indicating potential resting players or injuries not mentioned
2. The Curry injury is explicitly mentioned and impacts my recommendation on the Timberwolves
3. Need to consider if there are playoff dynamics at play

Given the constraints and information provided, I'll finalize my recommended bets below, assigning stakes based on confidence level.
