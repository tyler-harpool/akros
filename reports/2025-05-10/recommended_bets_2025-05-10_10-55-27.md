:

BET #1: Pacers vs Cavaliers Game 4 - Tyrese Haliburton Over XX.X Points (Odds: +XXX) (Stake: 2 units) - If Haliburton plays through the hamstring issue, books may set his point prop too low as they adjust for the injury. Back the over if the line seems suppressed.

BET #2: Thunder vs Nuggets Series Price - Thunder +XXX (Stake: 3 units) - With Murray potentially limited, OKC's stout defense could make this a longer series than expected. Take the generous series price on the Thunder if the line overadjusts to Denver being home favorites.

BET #3: Timberwolves vs Warriors Game 4 - Steph Curry Over XX.X 3-Pointers Made (Odds: +XXX) (Stake: 2 units) - Expect the Warriors to make getting Curry open looks a priority after struggling in Game 3. If his 3-point prop seems too low, back the over as he heats up.  

BET #4: Celtics vs Knicks Game 3 - Knicks Team Total Over XXX.X (Odds: +XXX) (Stake: 2 units) - New York has been hot offensively, and Boston may start selling out to slow them down. If the Knicks' team total is set too low, they could still hit the over in a potential shootout.

BET #5: Pacers vs Cavaliers Game 4 - Alternate Spread Pacers +XX.X (Odds: +XXX) (Stake: 3 units) - If Haliburton plays and the line heavily favors Cleveland, taking Indiana with an inflated alternate spread could provide value if they keep it close.

That's my analysis on some potential edges based on the injuries, series contexts and potential market overreactions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional thoughts!
