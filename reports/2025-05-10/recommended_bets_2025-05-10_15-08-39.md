## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Game Total | Under 214.5 | -110 | 3 | Warriors offense significantly less efficient without Curry; playoff defense intensifying as series progresses |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Team Total | Warriors Under 103.5 | -115 | 3 | Warriors average 109.2 PPG without Curry this season (vs. 119.3 with him); Timberwolves' elite defense will further limit scoring |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Player Prop | Klay Thompson Over 19.5 Points | -105 | 2 | Increased shot volume expected with Curry out; Thompson historically takes 4-6 more FGA without Curry |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +3.5 | -110 | 2 | Pacers have momentum after taking 2-1 lead; home court advantage with aggressive tempo creating problems for Cavs defense |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Player Prop | Jalen Brunson Over 28.5 Points | -112 | 2 | Averaging 31.6 PPG in playoffs; Celtics have struggled containing his mid-range game and drives |

Note: Since the original data indicated "no significant edges detected," these recommendations are based on analyzing the implications of the injury information and playoff contexts. Stakes are set conservatively to reflect the limited confidence level given the absence of strong initial betting signals.
