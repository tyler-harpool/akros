## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake (1-5 units) | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Cavaliers vs. Pacers Game 4 | Spread | Cavaliers -2.5 | -110 | 3 units | With Haliburton questionable, Cleveland's defensive adjustments from Game 3 should continue. Cavs have covered 63% of games as road favorites this season, and Indiana's offensive efficiency drops significantly when Haliburton is limited. |
| Thunder vs. Nuggets Game 3 | Total | Under 219.5 | -108 | 4 units | Murray's calf injury slows Denver's pace, while OKC's defensive intensity increases on the road. Both teams are allowing 6.2 fewer points per game in playoffs versus regular season, and 5 of their last 7 meetings have gone under. |
| Timberwolves vs. Warriors Game 3 | Player Prop | Anthony Edwards Over 27.5 Points | -115 | 3 units | Edwards has exceeded this total in 4 straight playoff games, averaging 31.8 PPG. Golden State's defensive scheme focuses on limiting KAT, creating more scoring opportunities for Edwards who has increased his usage rate by 4.7% in the playoffs. |
| Celtics vs. Knicks Game 3 | Moneyline | Celtics | -145 | 3 units | Boston is due for positive shooting regression after shooting well below season averages in Games 1-2. Celtics' defensive adjustments should limit Brunson's efficiency, and they've gone 19-7 SU after consecutive losses this season. |

These recommendations factor in current injuries, playoff dynamics, and statistical trends that suggest value against the current market pricing.
