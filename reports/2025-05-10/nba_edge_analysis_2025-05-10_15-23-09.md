# NBA Playoff Betting Analysis

After analyzing the provided betting odds, injury reports, and playoff context, I've identified several opportunities that warrant consideration. Let me break down the key factors influencing these games.

## Key Situation Analysis

### Knicks vs Celtics
The massive 15.5-point spread is highly unusual for a playoff game, especially considering the Knicks lead the series 2-0. This suggests significant injury concerns for New York not fully detailed in the report. The detected statistical edge on both Boston -15.5 and New York +12.5 (at different books) presents an interesting situation. The 3-point difference between these lines indicates potential arbitrage or middling opportunities.

### Warriors vs Timberwolves
Stephen Curry's absence dramatically alters Golden State's offensive capabilities. The Warriors being 5.5-point home underdogs reflects this, but playoff home games often tighten, especially in tied series. The total of 200.5 appears to account for Curry's absence and Minnesota's elite defense.

### Nuggets vs Thunder
The defending champions are 6-point underdogs in a tied series, suggesting this game is in Oklahoma City. Denver's championship experience makes this spread potentially exploitable.

### Pacers vs Cavaliers
Indiana leads 2-1 but is a 5-point underdog, indicating this game is in Cleveland. The Pacers have proven they can compete in this series, making the spread intriguing.

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +12.5 | +112 | 3 | Statistical edge of 5.71% with superior EV (0.1211). While 15.5 points is extreme for a playoff game, the alternate line at +12.5 provides cushion while maintaining positive expectation. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -110 | 3 | Curry's absence severely impacts Warriors' offensive efficiency and spacing. Minnesota has the #1 defensive rating in the playoffs, and this matchup has averaged just 198.5 points through two games. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6 | -115 | 4 | Defending champions with championship experience are valuable as substantial underdogs. Denver's core remains intact, and JokiÄ‡ tends to elevate his game in critical playoff moments. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5 | -108 | 2 | Indiana has won 2 of 3 games and demonstrated they can compete with Cleveland. Their pace and offensive versatility should keep this competitive even on the road. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -110 | 2 | Despite Curry's absence, playoff home teams typically overperform. Golden State's role players should step up at home in this pivotal game. Warriors are 20-4 in their last 24 playoff home games. |

Remember to verify all injury information before placing bets, as late-breaking news can significantly impact these recommendations. The Knicks-Celtics spread in particular suggests there may be major roster news not fully reflected in the provided injury report.

Player props often present the biggest market inefficiencies. Consider these factors when analyzing player props:

1. **Minutes projection** - The foundation of all player prop analysis
2. **Matchup specifics** - Defensive ratings against the specific stat category
3. **Recent role changes** - Lineup adjustments in playoff series
4. **Pace impact** - How game tempo affects counting stats
