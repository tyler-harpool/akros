After analyzing the data and considering the key injuries, lineup changes, and playoff context, here are my recommended bets:

### RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Cavaliers vs Pacers Game 4 | Spread | Cavaliers -4.5 | -110 | 3 units | With Haliburton questionable, the Cavaliers should be able to take advantage at home and even the series. Their defense has been stout and the line seems short. |
| Celtics vs Knicks Game 3 | Total | Under 216.5 | -105 | 2 units | Both teams have clamped down defensively in the playoffs. With the series shifting to Boston, expect another grind-it-out, low-scoring affair. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets Game 4 | Player Prop | Nikola Jokic Over 25.5 Points | +100 | 2 units | Jokic has stepped up with Murray out, averaging 29 PPG in the series. Expect another huge offensive load at home to tie it up. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors Game 4 | Moneyline | Warriors -165 | -165 | 3 units | With Curry likely back, the Warriors should protect home court. They've been excellent at making adjustments and will look to regain control of the series. |

## Playoff-Specific Insights

### Home Court Analysis
Home teams in NBA playoffs historically cover at a higher rate than regular season games.

### Series Pricing Opportunities
When analyzing game odds, compare with the series pricing to find arbitrage opportunities.

### Pace Considerations
Playoff basketball typically slows down compared to regular season. Consider this when analyzing totals.


## Player Props Analysis

Player props often present the biggest market inefficiencies. Consider these factors when analyzing player props:

1. **Minutes projection** - The foundation of all player prop analysis
2. **Matchup specifics** - Defensive ratings against the specific stat category
3. **Recent role changes** - Lineup adjustments in playoff series
4. **Pace impact** - How game tempo affects counting stats
