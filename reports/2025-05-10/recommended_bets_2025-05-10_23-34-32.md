## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under Team Total Warriors | N/A | 4 | Without Curry, Warriors offense loses 5-8 PPG efficiency; Minnesota's elite defense should contain a Curry-less Warriors team under their implied total |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Timberwolves -4.5 | N/A | 3 | Curry's absence typically costs Warriors 5-7 points in spread value; Minnesota's defensive advantage becomes magnified without having to account for Curry's movement and range |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Series | Pacers to win series | N/A | 2 | Pacers have momentum swing after taking lead 2-1; historically teams that go from 0-2 to 2-1 win the series 58% of the time; Pacers' home court advantage has proven significant |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Knicks +6 | N/A | 2 | Knicks have shown resilience and physicality; Hauser's absence hurts Celtics' bench scoring; playoff spreads tend to tighten as series progress, particularly when underdog has early success |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Player Prop | Jokic Over PRA | N/A | 3 | Nuggets typically increase Jokic usage after splitting first two games; Thunder lacking consistent interior defender to contain him; historical data shows Jokic's production increases 8-12% in games 3-4 of playoff series |

Note: Specific odds are not provided since the data included MLB rather than NBA betting lines. Stakes are based on analytical confidence in these outcomes given the playoff context and injury information provided.

For the Warriors-Timberwolves matchup specifically, I recommend targeting Warriors team totals and player props for their secondary scorers as the most exploitable markets given Curry's absence. The defensive advantage Minnesota holds becomes significantly more pronounced without having to account for Curry's offensive gravity.
