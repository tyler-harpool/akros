Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities provided, paying special attention to the live game (Knicks vs Celtics) and the upcoming games.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (IN PROGRESS)

This game is currently in progress, and based on the odds, it appears that Boston is heavily favored with a huge lead:
- Moneyline: Boston is at -100000, which indicates they're effectively considered a lock to win
- Spread: Boston is favored by 17.5 to 21.5 points depending on the bookmaker
- This suggests Boston is dominating the game with a significant lead

The large spread (17.5-21.5 points) indicates the Celtics have a substantial lead over the Knicks. The moneyline at -100000 for Boston means bookmakers consider a Celtics victory to be almost certain at this point.

For totals, we see:
- DraftKings: 218.5 (-120/+110)
- FanDuel: 216.5 (-125/-106)
- BetMGM: 220.5 (-115/-110)

The variation in total points suggests some uncertainty about how many more points will be scored. This could be an opportunity if I can determine which way the total is likely to go based on game flow and tempo.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

This game hasn't started yet. The Timberwolves are favored:
- Moneyline: Minnesota around -225 to -230, Warriors at +185 to +190
- Spread: Minnesota -5.5 points consistently across all bookmakers
- Total: 200.5 points consistently across bookmakers

The consistency in the spread and total across bookmakers suggests the market has reached a consensus on this game. The Timberwolves are solid favorites, and the total is relatively low at 200.5, suggesting an expected defensive battle.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

Oklahoma City is favored:
- Moneyline ranges from -225 to -255 for OKC
- Spread: OKC favored by 6 to 6.5 points
- Total: 227 to 227.5 points

The higher total suggests a faster-paced, higher-scoring game is expected compared to the Warriors-Timberwolves matchup. There's a small discrepancy in the spread (6 vs 6.5) at different books, which might offer some value.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

Cleveland is favored:
- Moneyline ranges from -192 to -210 for Cleveland
- Spread: Cleveland favored by 4.5 to 5.5 points (notable variation)
- Total: 230.5 to 231 points

The high total reflects the Pacers' uptempo style of play. There's significant variation in the spread (4.5 to 5.5 points), which could offer potential value depending on team matchups and recent performance.

Let me think about potential betting opportunities:

### Live Betting (Knicks vs Celtics)

With Boston having such a large lead, there might be a tendency for them to take their foot off the gas in the fourth quarter, potentially allowing the Knicks to cut into the lead somewhat. This could create value in:

1. The total market: If Boston's starters get pulled early, scoring might slow down, favoring the under.
2. The spread market: If Boston empties the bench early, New York might cover a very large spread.

However, without knowing the exact game situation (time remaining, quarter, specific score), it's hard to make a confident recommendation on the live game.

### Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

The Timberwolves are clear favorites here, which aligns with their strong defensive identity this season. The total of 200.5 is low, reflecting Minnesota's defense-first approach. 

Golden State's home-court advantage is typically strong, but the line suggests Minnesota is significantly better. If Golden State has key players returning from injury or Minnesota has key absences, there could be value on Golden State +5.5, but without detailed lineup information, it's hard to make a strong recommendation.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder are favored by 6-6.5 points over the Nuggets, which is interesting given Denver's championship pedigree. This suggests either key injuries for Denver or strong recent form from OKC. The total of 227-227.5 indicates an expected high-scoring affair.

There's a small arbitrage opportunity between bookmakers on the spread (6 vs 6.5), which could be exploited in certain circumstances.

### Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

This game features the biggest spread discrepancy across bookmakers (4.5 to 5.5), which suggests some uncertainty about the appropriate line. The Pacers are known for their fast-paced style, while Cleveland has been more defensive-minded.

The high total (230.5-231) reflects the Pacers' pace, but if Cleveland can control tempo, there could be value on the under.

Now, let me formulate 3-5 concrete betting recommendations based on this analysis:

1. For the Knicks vs Celtics live game, without knowing the exact game situation (time, score, quarter), I'll make a tentative recommendation on the total, assuming we're in the second half with Boston having a large lead. The likelihood of slower pace with bench players could favor the under.

2. For Warriors vs Timberwolves, I'm inclined to favor the under on total points. At 200.5, this is already a low total, but Minnesota's elite defense can typically keep scores down.

3. For Nuggets vs Thunder, there's value in taking Denver +6.5 at BetMGM, as Denver tends to perform well as underdogs and has championship experience.

4. For Pacers vs Cavaliers, I see value in taking Cleveland -4.5 at DraftKings, as this is the lowest spread available across bookmakers.

5. Also for Pacers vs Cavaliers, the under 231 at FanDuel could be valuable if Cleveland can control the pace of the game.

Let me finalize these recommendations:

Wait, there's something strange about the Knicks-Celtics odds. The moneyline of 4000 for the home team and -100000 for the away team suggests an extremely lopsided game, which seems unusual. Let me double-check which team is home and which is away.

Based on the provided information, it says "New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics," which typically means New York is home (listed first) and Boston is away. However, the odds suggest Boston is dominating. This could mean either:
1. The game is actually in Boston, not New York
2. Boston has a massive lead despite playing in New York
3. There's an error in the data

Without further clarification, I'll assume the second scenario - that Boston is heavily winning despite playing in New York. This happens in playoff scenarios where the lower seed (possibly Boston in this case) dominates on the road.

Given this context, and without knowing the exact game situation (time, quarter, etc.), it's difficult to make a high-confidence live bet recommendation. The extremely lopsided odds suggest Boston has all but won the game.

Let me focus on the upcoming games where I can provide more reliable recommendations:

1. For Warriors vs Timberwolves: Under 200.5 points seems valuable given Minnesota's defensive prowess.

2. For Nuggets vs Thunder: Denver +6.5 at BetMGM offers the best value, especially if Denver has their key players available.

3. For Pacers vs Cavaliers: Cleveland -4.5 at DraftKings offers value as the lowest spread available across bookmakers.

4. Also for Pacers vs Cavaliers: Under 231 points at FanDuel could be valuable if Cleveland can control the pace.

Here's my finalized list of recommended bets:
