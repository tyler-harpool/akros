## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +12.5 | +112 | 3 | Statistical edge of 5.71% with superior EV (0.1211). While 15.5 points is extreme for a playoff game, the alternate line at +12.5 provides cushion while maintaining positive expectation. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -110 | 3 | Curry's absence severely impacts Warriors' offensive efficiency and spacing. Minnesota has the #1 defensive rating in the playoffs, and this matchup has averaged just 198.5 points through two games. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6 | -115 | 4 | Defending champions with championship experience are valuable as substantial underdogs. Denver's core remains intact, and JokiÄ‡ tends to elevate his game in critical playoff moments. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5 | -108 | 2 | Indiana has won 2 of 3 games and demonstrated they can compete with Cleveland. Their pace and offensive versatility should keep this competitive even on the road. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +5.5 | -110 | 2 | Despite Curry's absence, playoff home teams typically overperform. Golden State's role players should step up at home in this pivotal game. Warriors are 20-4 in their last 24 playoff home games. |

Remember to verify all injury information before placing bets, as late-breaking news can significantly impact these recommendations. The Knicks-Celtics spread in particular suggests there may be major roster news not fully reflected in the provided injury report.
