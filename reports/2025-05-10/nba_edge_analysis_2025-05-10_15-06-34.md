# NBA Playoff Betting Analysis

After analyzing the provided data, I'll examine the potential betting edges across today's NBA playoff games, with particular attention to how injuries and playoff dynamics affect these opportunities.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics Analysis

The data shows three potential edges in this matchup:
- Knicks moneyline at +680 (3.58% edge)
- Over 207.5 at -108 (3.08% edge)
- Under 206.5 at +100 (4.22% edge)

The Knicks currently lead the series 2-0, which makes the +680 moneyline interesting despite Boston being heavily favored at home. Sam Hauser's absence for Boston (ankle) is notable but not game-changing. The total points market shows conflicting edges with both over and under showing value at different numbers, suggesting the true total is likely between 206.5-207.5.

The large spread (Knicks +12.5) indicates oddsmakers expect Boston to respond strongly at home after dropping the first two games at Madison Square Garden. Playoff dynamics suggest Boston should play with increased urgency, but the Knicks have shown tremendous defensive resilience in this series.

## Warriors vs Timberwolves Analysis

Stephen Curry's absence is the most significant injury factor in this game. Without their offensive engine, the Warriors' offensive efficiency will likely suffer substantially. The spread of Warriors +5.5 reflects this, but may not fully account for Curry's impact on Golden State's offensive spacing and scoring capability.

The total of 200.5 is notably low for NBA standards, reflecting both teams' defensive capabilities and the expected offensive struggles for Golden State without Curry.

## Nuggets vs Thunder Analysis

This series is tied 1-1, with Denver getting a 6-point spread at home. The Nuggets have no major injuries, while the Thunder are also relatively healthy. The total of 227 is the highest among today's games, suggesting oddsmakers expect an up-tempo, high-scoring affair.

## Pacers vs Cavaliers Analysis

The Pacers lead this series 2-1 and are 5-point underdogs on the road. The total of 231 points indicates expectations for an offensive-oriented game. Indiana has no significant injuries that would impact the betting lines.

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +680 | 1 | Highest EV bet with 3.58% edge; Knicks have shown defensive prowess and are up 2-0 in series |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 206.5 | +100 | 3 | Strongest edge (4.22%) with positive odds; playoff intensity typically favors unders, especially in crucial Game 3s |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves -5.5 | -110 | 4 | Curry's absence severely limits Warriors' offense; Minnesota's defense can capitalize against a depleted GSW attack |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Over 227 | -110 | 2 | Both teams have shown offensive firepower in this series; Denver plays faster at home and should push pace in crucial Game 3 |

My highest confidence bet is on the Timberwolves covering against the Warriors without Curry. His absence fundamentally changes Golden State's offensive identity and ability to create spacing. The Knicks moneyline offers tremendous value at +680 despite the low probability, warranting a small stake given the edge percentage. The Knicks-Celtics under 206.5 at even money represents the largest statistical edge in the data and aligns with typical playoff patterns of tighter defensive games, especially in pivotal matchups.

## Player Props Analysis

Player props often present the biggest market inefficiencies. Consider these factors when analyzing player props:

1. **Minutes projection** - The foundation of all player prop analysis
2. **Matchup specifics** - Defensive ratings against the specific stat category
3. **Recent role changes** - Lineup adjustments in playoff series
4. **Pace impact** - How game tempo affects counting stats
