Let me analyze the betting opportunities presented here, focusing on the games with identified edges while considering injuries, playoff context, and statistical data.

First, I'll review the detected edges:

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Edge 1: Boston Celtics @ -15.5 with odds -110 (5.24% edge, 0.1000 expected value)
- Edge 2: New York Knicks @ +12.5 with odds +112 (5.71% edge, 0.1211 expected value)

These two edges represent opposite sides of the same game but at different spread numbers. The Knicks spread at +12.5 has slightly better odds and edge percentage, suggesting it might be the better bet. However, I need to consider the context.

Now let's examine the playoff context and injury situation for each game:

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Series status: Knicks lead 2-0
- Injuries: Boston is missing Sam Hauser (ankle)
- Spread: Boston -15.5 (which is extremely high for a playoff game)

The 15.5 point spread for Boston is unusually high for a playoff game. This suggests there might be significant injury news for the Knicks that isn't explicitly mentioned in the injury report provided. The Knicks are up 2-0 in the series, which makes a 15.5 point spread even more unusual. I need to infer what might be happening:

1. The Knicks might be resting key players or have suffered new injuries
2. The series is shifting to Boston and the home court advantage is being heavily factored in
3. The previous games might have been close despite the Knicks wins

Let me now analyze the other games to see if there are any potential betting opportunities:

### Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Series status: Tied 1-1
- Key injury: Stephen Curry (out, hamstring) for Warriors
- Spread: Warriors +5.5

Curry's absence is massive for the Warriors. He's their primary offensive engine and his absence will impact their scoring ability, spacing, and overall offensive efficiency. The Warriors will likely rely more on Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, and others to generate offense. The spread of +5.5 for the Warriors at home suggests the market has already factored in Curry's absence significantly.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Series status: Tied 1-1
- No major injuries listed that would significantly impact
- Spread: Nuggets +6

The defending champions are 6-point underdogs, suggesting this game is in Oklahoma City. The series is tied 1-1, and the teams are likely heading to Denver's home court soon.

### Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Series status: Pacers lead 2-1
- No major injuries listed for key players
- Spread: Pacers +5

The Pacers are leading the series 2-1 but are 5-point underdogs, suggesting this game is in Cleveland.

Now let me apply these insights to develop betting recommendations:

### Knicks vs Celtics
The unusual 15.5 point spread suggests something significant is happening with the Knicks roster. If the Knicks are indeed severely shorthanded, the Celtics could cover this large spread at home when facing a playoff elimination. However, without confirming what exactly is happening with the Knicks roster, this bet carries significant risk. The edge calculation suggests there's value, but context is crucial here.

### Warriors vs Timberwolves
With Curry out, the Warriors are substantial underdogs at home. The line of +5.5 seems to have already factored in Curry's absence. However, playoff basketball often tightens, especially in crucial games. The Warriors still have experienced playoff performers who might step up at home. This game total is set at 200.5, which is relatively low and reflects Curry's absence.

### Nuggets vs Thunder
The defending champions as 6-point underdogs presents an interesting opportunity. Denver has championship experience and typically performs well in playoff situations. Without major injury concerns listed, they could be a strong value play as underdogs.

### Pacers vs Cavaliers
The Pacers leading the series 2-1 but being 5-point underdogs in Cleveland suggests the market expects a strong bounce-back from the Cavs. Given the competitive nature of this series, a 5-point spread could be exploitable.

Based on the provided information and analysis, I'll recommend the following bets:

1. Knicks +12.5 (+112) - Despite the edge calculation, I'm cautious about this bet without knowing the full injury context. The unusually large spread suggests major roster issues for the Knicks, but the detected edge suggests value.

2. Warriors +5.5 (-110) - Home playoff games tend to be competitive, and the Warriors have championship experience and crowd support to keep this close even without Curry.

3. Nuggets +6 (-115) - The defending champions as 6-point underdogs seems to provide value, especially with no major injury concerns listed.

4. Pacers +5 (-108) - The Pacers have shown they can compete with and beat the Cavaliers in this series. Leading 2-1, they should be able to keep this game competitive even on the road.

5. Under 200.5 (-110) for Warriors vs Timberwolves - With Curry out, the Warriors' offensive efficiency will decline significantly. The Timberwolves are an excellent defensive team, so a lower-scoring game is expected.

Let me verify these recommendations with the statistical edges provided and the contextual information:

For the Knicks vs Celtics game, there are two conflicting edges (Celtics -15.5 and Knicks +12.5), which is unusual. The +12.5 has a slightly better edge percentage and expected value. Without additional context on the significant injury situation that must be behind such a large spread, I'll stick with the recommendation based on the better statistical edge.

For the other games, I'm basing recommendations on the playoff context, home/away considerations, and injury impact, especially Curry's absence for the Warriors.
