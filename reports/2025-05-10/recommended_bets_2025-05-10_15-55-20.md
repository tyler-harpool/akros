## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves -5.5 | -110 | 4 units | Curry's absence creates a significant offensive void for Golden State. Minnesota's elite defense should dominate against a Warriors team missing their primary creator and scoring threat. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -105 | 3 units | Without Curry, Warriors' offensive efficiency drops significantly. Minnesota already plays at a slow pace with strong defensive identity, creating perfect conditions for an under. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -115 | 2 units | The defending champions getting 6.5 points at home offers value. Denver's playoff experience and championship DNA should keep this competitive, even against an impressive OKC team. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -115 | 2 units | Indiana's high-powered offense keeps them competitive in most games. BetMGM offers the most favorable spread, and the Pacers should keep this within the number at home. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 220.5 | -115 | 1 unit | In extreme blowouts, pace typically slows in the fourth quarter as benches empty. BetMGM offers the highest total among bookmakers, creating value on the under side. |

These recommendations balance risk and reward while accounting for key factors like injuries (particularly Curry's absence) and playoff dynamics that affect game outcomes and totals.
