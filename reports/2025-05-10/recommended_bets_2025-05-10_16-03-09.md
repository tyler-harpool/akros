## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Nuggets vs Thunder Game 4 | Game Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 3 units | Both teams are healthy and have been scoring at a high clip. With a crucial game 4, expect an uptempo, high-scoring affair as they look to take control of the series. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors Game 4 | Player Prop | Stephen Curry Over 27.5 Points | +105 | 2 units | Curry is probable and should be motivated after a poor shooting performance in Game 3. The Warriors will likely lean on him more at home to even the series. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers Game 4 | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -105 | 2 units | With Haliburton potentially returning, the Pacers should be able to keep this game close on the road against the Cavs. They've been very competitive so far in the series. |
