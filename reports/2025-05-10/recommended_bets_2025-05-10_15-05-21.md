## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Game Total | Under 217.5 | -110 | 4 | Warriors offense significantly hampered without Curry; Minnesota already elite defensively (1st in DRTG); playoff intensity further suppresses scoring |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Timberwolves -6.5 | -108 | 3 | Warriors struggle significantly without Curry (8-10 point drop in offensive rating); Minnesota's defense can capitalize on his absence |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Series | Knicks to win | +145 | 3 | Knicks already up 2-0 with home court advantage coming; Hauser's absence hurts Boston's spacing; odds don't fully reflect series situation |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +3.5 | -105 | 2 | Pacers have proven they can compete and lead series 2-1; market still respecting Cavs too much as the higher seed |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Series | Thunder to win | +115 | 1 | Young Thunder team has matched defending champions; OKC's athleticism and depth provide advantages as series progresses |

These recommendations focus on exploiting market inefficiencies created by injury situations (particularly Curry's absence) and series dynamics that may not be fully priced into the current lines. The strongest edge appears to be in the Warriors-Timberwolves matchups where Curry's absence fundamentally changes the competitive balance.
