Let me analyze each of these NBA games individually, looking for potential betting value based on the information provided.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

The first thing that jumps out here is the extremely lopsided moneyline odds. Boston is a massive favorite with odds like -50000 and -100000, while New York is at +3300 to +4000. These are extraordinary odds that suggest Boston is virtually guaranteed to win.

The spread is also remarkable - ranging from 22.5 to 25.5 points in Boston's favor. This is an unusually large spread for an NBA game, especially in what appears to be a playoff context.

Given these numbers, this appears to be a situation where:
1. Boston might be up 3-0 in a playoff series and has completely dominated
2. New York might be dealing with multiple significant injuries
3. This could be an elimination game where New York has essentially given up

The totals are set around 214.5-215.5, which is average for an NBA game. 

Without explicit injury information, my guess is that New York is severely undermanned. The extreme odds suggest a complete mismatch that's virtually unprecedented in typical NBA games.

Potential value: Given the extreme nature of these lines, I'd be very cautious. The spread is so large that even a meaningless late run by bench players could swing the cover. If I had to look for value, the under might make sense if New York can't score effectively, but Boston may also score at will.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves

The odds here are much more reasonable and represent a competitive game. Minnesota is favored with moneyline odds around -225 to -230, while Golden State is around +185 to +190.

The spread is consistently set at 5.5 points in Minnesota's favor across all bookmakers.

The total is set at 200.5 points, which is relatively low for an NBA game, suggesting expectations of a defensive battle or slower pace.

This appears to be a playoff matchup where Minnesota has home-court advantage and is moderately favored. The identical spread across all bookmakers suggests market consensus.

Potential value: The identical lines across books suggest the market is efficient. The low total could be interesting if we believe one team's offense will outperform expectations.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

Denver is favored with moneyline odds around -225 to -255, while Oklahoma City is at +185 to +210.

The spread ranges from 6 to 6.5 points in Denver's favor.

The total is set around 227-227.5, which is relatively high and suggests expectations of a faster-paced, offensive game.

There's a slight discrepancy in the spread between bookmakers, with BetMGM offering 6.5 while others offer 6.

Potential value: The half-point difference in spread at BetMGM could offer value depending on our assessment of the game. The higher total suggests a potentially entertaining, high-scoring affair.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers

Cleveland is favored with moneyline odds around -192 to -210, while Indiana is at +160 to +172.

The spread ranges from 4.5 to 5.5 points in Cleveland's favor, with some variation between bookmakers.

The total is set around 230.5-231, suggesting expectations of a high-scoring game.

There's noteworthy variation in the spread across bookmakers: DraftKings has 4.5, FanDuel has 5, and BetMGM has 5.5.

Potential value: The spread variation offers potential value. DraftKings gives the best line for betting Indiana (+4.5), while BetMGM offers the best line for betting Cleveland (-5.5).

Now, let's evaluate potential betting opportunities across these games:

1. **Knicks vs Celtics**: Extreme odds make this difficult to find value, but the spread variance is significant (22.5 to 25.5). If betting this game, I'd look at BetMGM's -22.5 for Boston if we believe in a complete blowout, or FanDuel's +25.5 for New York if we think they can keep it relatively competitive.

2. **Warriors vs Timberwolves**: Market consensus suggests limited opportunities. The total of 200.5 is the most interesting aspect - BetMGM offers the best odds on the over at -115.

3. **Nuggets vs Thunder**: The half-point difference in spread at BetMGM (6.5) versus others (6) is meaningful. If backing Denver, getting -6 at DraftKings/FanDuel is preferable to -6.5. Conversely, if backing OKC, getting +6.5 at BetMGM is preferable to +6 elsewhere.

4. **Pacers vs Cavaliers**: The spread variation provides clear opportunities. If backing Indiana, take +5.5 at BetMGM. If backing Cleveland, take -4.5 at DraftKings.

Based on this analysis, here are the potential betting opportunities with the best available odds:

1. Knicks +25.5 (FanDuel, +102) - If we believe New York can keep it somewhat competitive
2. Thunder +6.5 (BetMGM, -105) - Half-point value if we like OKC
3. Pacers +5.5 (BetMGM, -115) - Best spread available for Indiana
4. Cavaliers -4.5 (DraftKings, -112) - Best spread available for Cleveland
5. Warriors/Timberwolves Under 200.5 (BetMGM, -105) - Best odds for what appears to be a defensive matchup

Without more information on injuries, team trends, or playoff contexts, these represent the purely odds-based opportunities. But to make more confident recommendations, I'd want to know more about the current state of these teams and series.

Since we don't have specific injury information or detailed context about these playoff matchups, I'll make some educated assumptions based on the betting lines and provide recommendations with appropriate caution.

Let me now finalize my 3-5 recommended bets with reasoning:
