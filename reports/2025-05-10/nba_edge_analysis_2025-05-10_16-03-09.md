After analyzing the available data, injuries, lineup changes, and playoff context, here are my recommended bets for today's NBA slate:

### RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Nuggets vs Thunder Game 4 | Game Total | Over 225.5 | -110 | 3 units | Both teams are healthy and have been scoring at a high clip. With a crucial game 4, expect an uptempo, high-scoring affair as they look to take control of the series. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors Game 4 | Player Prop | Stephen Curry Over 27.5 Points | +105 | 2 units | Curry is probable and should be motivated after a poor shooting performance in Game 3. The Warriors will likely lean on him more at home to even the series. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers Game 4 | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -105 | 2 units | With Haliburton potentially returning, the Pacers should be able to keep this game close on the road against the Cavs. They've been very competitive so far in the series. |

## Playoff-Specific Insights

### Home Court Analysis
Home teams in NBA playoffs historically cover at a higher rate than regular season games.

### Series Pricing Opportunities
When analyzing game odds, compare with the series pricing to find arbitrage opportunities.

### Pace Considerations
Playoff basketball typically slows down compared to regular season. Consider this when analyzing totals.


## Player Props Analysis

Player props often present the biggest market inefficiencies. Consider these factors when analyzing player props:

1. **Minutes projection** - The foundation of all player prop analysis
2. **Matchup specifics** - Defensive ratings against the specific stat category
3. **Recent role changes** - Lineup adjustments in playoff series
4. **Pace impact** - How game tempo affects counting stats
