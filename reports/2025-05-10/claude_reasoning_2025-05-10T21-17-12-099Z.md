Let me analyze the provided betting opportunities for the four NBA games on May 10-11, 2025. I'll evaluate each game considering the odds across different bookmakers, potential edges, and make recommendations.

## 1. New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/10/2025)

The odds here are extremely lopsided:
- Moneyline: Boston is heavily favored with odds ranging from -10000 to -50000
- Spread: Boston is favored by 20.5-23.5 points
- Totals: Range from 218.5 to 222.5 points

This indicates a massive mismatch. The Celtics are overwhelming favorites, suggesting this might be a playoff series clincher where the Knicks are potentially severely depleted or demoralized. The enormous spread of 20.5-23.5 points is rarely seen in NBA playoff games, indicating something unusual about this matchup.

No specific injuries were mentioned, but these odds suggest key Knicks players might be out. With such extreme odds, there's very little value in betting the Celtics moneyline (the return would be minimal). The spread is extremely high, making it risky to bet on either side without more information.

The total points market shows some discrepancy between bookmakers (4-point difference), which might present a small opportunity.

## 2. Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/10/2025)

The odds are more balanced here:
- Moneyline: Minnesota favored at around -225 to -230, with Warriors at +185 to +190
- Spread: Minnesota favored by 5.5 points across all bookmakers
- Totals: Consistent at 200.5 points

This suggests a competitive game but with Minnesota having a clear advantage, likely playing at home. The consistency across bookmakers indicates market consensus about this matchup.

The 200.5 total points line is relatively low for NBA standards, suggesting this could be a defensive battle or slower-paced game, which aligns with Minnesota's typical style of play with their defensive anchors.

## 3. Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/11/2025)

The odds show OKC as the favorite:
- Moneyline: OKC favored at -225 to -255, with Denver at +185 to +210
- Spread: OKC favored by 6-6.5 points
- Totals: Around 227-227.5 points

There's a slight discrepancy in the spread line between bookmakers, with BetMGM offering 6.5 points while others offer 6. This small difference could present value depending on which side you favor.

The higher total suggests a faster-paced, higher-scoring game compared to the Warriors-Timberwolves matchup.

## 4. Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (5/11/2025)

The odds show Cleveland as the favorite:
- Moneyline: Cleveland favored at -192 to -210, with Pacers at +160 to +172
- Spread: Cleveland favored by 4.5-5.5 points
- Totals: Around 230.5-231 points

There's notable variation in the spread across bookmakers: DraftKings has 4.5, FanDuel has 5, and BetMGM has 5.5. This presents potential arbitrage or value opportunities.

The high total of 230.5-231 points suggests an up-tempo game, which aligns with the Pacers' typical style of play.

# Identifying Value Bets

Now I'll look for the best values across these games:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
This game shows extreme odds that make betting difficult. The spread is massive (20.5-23.5 points), and there's a 4-point discrepancy in totals between bookmakers. Without knowing the specific circumstances (injuries, etc.), the potential value might be in the totals market. DraftKings offers the lowest total at 218.5, while FanDuel has it at 222.5. Given the extreme spread, Boston may ease off late in the game, making the under more appealing.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
The lines are consistent across bookmakers, suggesting the market is efficient. Minnesota at -5.5 seems reasonable, but the Warriors have playoff experience that could keep this close. The total of 200.5 is low by NBA standards, reflecting Minnesota's defensive capabilities. BetMGM offers slightly better odds on the over at -115, which could represent a small edge if you believe this game might be higher scoring.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
The spread discrepancy (6 points vs. 6.5 points) offers a potential edge. If backing Denver, the +6.5 at BetMGM offers the best value. FanDuel offers the best odds for Denver on the moneyline at +210. For a total of 227-227.5, NBA playoff games often tighten defensively, potentially favoring the under.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
The spread variation (4.5 to 5.5 points) offers clear value opportunities. If backing Indiana, BetMGM's +5.5 at -115 provides the most cushion. If backing Cleveland, DraftKings' -4.5 at -112 requires the smallest margin of victory. For totals, BetMGM's under 230.5 at -105 offers better odds than competitors.

# Recommended Bets

Based on this analysis, here are my recommended bets:

1. **Nuggets +6.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: This offers a half-point advantage over other bookmakers. Denver has championship experience and typically performs well in playoff environments, making the extra half-point valuable.

2. **Pacers +5.5 (-115) on BetMGM**: Best spread available for Indiana across bookmakers, giving an extra point of cushion compared to DraftKings.

3. **Warriors-Timberwolves Under 200.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: Minnesota's defensive style and playoff intensity suggest a lower-scoring game, and BetMGM offers slightly better odds than competitors.

4. **Celtics-Knicks Under 218.5 (-115) on DraftKings**: With such a massive spread, Boston likely eases up late, and this is the lowest total offered across bookmakers.

I'll now format these recommendations according to the required format, adjusting the confidence levels (stakes) based on the analysis.

Actually, let me reconsider the Celtics-Knicks game. The extreme odds suggest an unusual situation that makes betting risky without more information. Let me substitute a different bet.

For the Pacers vs Cavaliers game, the total at BetMGM (230.5 at -105 for the under) offers value compared to FanDuel's 231 at -110. These teams might play at a high pace, but playoff intensity often reduces scoring, making the under attractive.

So my fourth recommendation would be:
4. **Pacers-Cavaliers Under 230.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: Slightly better odds and lower total than FanDuel, in a playoff context where defense typically intensifies.

However, I'm still not fully satisfied with this selection. Let me consider the Celtics-Knicks game again.

The extreme spread in the Celtics-Knicks game (20.5-23.5 points) is unusual for NBA playoffs. If this is a closeout game where the Knicks are severely undermanned, there might be value in the alternative bet: taking the Knicks at +23.5 (-112) on FanDuel. This is because:
1. Even in blowouts, the winning team often takes their foot off the gas in the fourth quarter
2. Garbage time can allow the trailing team to cut the deficit
3. 23.5 points is an extremely large cushion

So my fourth recommendation would be:
4. **Knicks +23.5 (-112) on FanDuel**: An extremely large spread that provides significant cushion in a game that's expected to be a blowout.

Wait, let me reconsider everything again. The moneyline odds for the Knicks-Celtics game are ridiculously one-sided (-10000 to -50000 for Celtics), which suggests this might be a Game 7 where key Knicks players are injured. In that context, even the massive spread might not be enough.

Let me focus on finding clear value based on discrepancies between bookmakers or identifying situations where the market might be mispriced.

For the Indiana-Cleveland game, DraftKings offers Pacers +4.5 (-108) while BetMGM has Pacers +5.5 (-115). That's a full point difference with only a small odds adjustment. This represents a clear value opportunity if backing the Pacers.

For Denver-OKC, BetMGM offers Nuggets +6.5 (-105) while other books have +6, again representing a half-point advantage.

For Warriors-Timberwolves, the lines are consistent across bookmakers, but the historical playoff performance of the Warriors might suggest value in the underdog moneyline, particularly at DraftKings where they offer +190.

I think my final recommendations will be:

1. **Nuggets +6.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: Half-point advantage over other bookmakers for a team with championship experience.

2. **Pacers +5.5 (-115) on BetMGM**: Full point advantage over DraftKings, significant in what should be a competitive game.

3. **Warriors Moneyline +190 on DraftKings**: Best odds for a team with championship pedigree and playoff experience.

4. **Pacers-Cavaliers Under 230.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: Best odds on the under in a playoff game that could be more defensive than the regular season matchups.

Let me revise the stakes for these bets based on confidence:

1. **Nuggets +6.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: 3 units - Good value with the extra half-point, but OKC is still a strong team.

2. **Pacers +5.5 (-115) on BetMGM**: 4 units - Full point advantage over other bookmakers represents significant value.

3. **Warriors Moneyline +190 on DraftKings**: 2 units - Riskier bet but Warriors' playoff experience makes this worth a smaller play.

4. **Pacers-Cavaliers Under 230.5 (-105) on BetMGM**: 3 units - Playoff games often trend under, and this has the best odds among bookmakers.
