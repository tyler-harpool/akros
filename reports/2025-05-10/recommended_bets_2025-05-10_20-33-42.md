## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Timberwolves G3 | Spread | Timberwolves -4 | -110 | 2 | Curry's absence leaves Warriors without their offensive engine against the NBA's top defense. Minnesota should control tempo and exploit mismatches. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves G3 | Total | Under 220.5 | -110 | 2 | Warriors missing 30+ PPG from Curry and his spacing; Minnesota already elite defensively and can focus attention on remaining scorers. |
| Celtics vs Knicks G3 | Spread | Celtics -5.5 | -110 | 1 | Boston facing must-win situation down 0-2. Historically, favored teams respond with urgency in this situation, though Knicks' physicality has caused problems. |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers G4 | Player Prop | Tyrese Haliburton Over 19.5 Points | -115 | 1 | Haliburton becoming more aggressive as series progresses. Home court has boosted his confidence and shot selection in previous games. |
