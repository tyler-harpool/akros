## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +14.5 | -110 | 3 | Despite being down 0-2, a 14.5-point spread for Boston is excessive. Knicks have proven they can compete, and playoff games typically tighten in must-win scenarios. Series trends favor taking the points. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Timberwolves | -218 | 4 | Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense. Minnesota's elite defense should capitalize, and the Wolves showed dominance in Game 1. This price is justified given the star player absence. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6 | -115 | 2 | Defending champions with JokiÄ‡ are dangerous even on the road. Denver has demonstrated resilience and playoff experience. Six points provides cushion against a Thunder team still gaining playoff experience. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Over 231 | -110 | 2 | Both teams have shown offensive firepower in this series. Pacers play at one of the fastest paces in the league (3rd), while Cavs will push tempo at home facing a must-win situation down 2-1. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | H2H | Knicks | 800 | 1 | Model shows 4.29% edge with positive expected value. While a straight upset is less likely than covering the spread, the 8-to-1 payout offers value for a team that's already won twice in this series. |

Remember to verify all injury statuses before placing these bets, as playoff injury reporting can change rapidly and significantly impact these recommendations.
