Let's break down the information provided and look for possible betting opportunities:

1. The initial statement mentions "No significant edges detected in today's NBA markets" - suggesting that we don't have strong initial signals of market inefficiencies.

2. We have a very extensive injury report across the league. I'll need to focus on the teams that are actually playing in the current playoff matchups.

3. Current playoff matchups:
   - Eastern Conference: Cavaliers vs. Pacers (Pacers lead 2-1), Celtics vs. Knicks (Knicks lead 2-0)
   - Western Conference: Thunder vs. Nuggets (Series tied 1-1), Timberwolves vs. Warriors (Series tied 1-1)

Let's analyze each of these playoff matchups:

**Warriors vs. Timberwolves (Series tied 1-1)**
- Key injury: Stephen Curry (Out) for Warriors - this is extremely significant
- Timberwolves: Rob Dillingham (Out) - less impactful as he's not a core rotation player

Curry's absence is massive. He's the offensive engine for the Warriors, their primary scorer, playmaker, and the player who creates space for others with his gravity. Without him:
- Warriors offense will likely struggle significantly
- More offensive burden on Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, and possibly Jonathan Kuminga
- Defensive attention will shift to other players
- Pace could slow down as the Warriors may need to be more deliberate without Curry's transition threat

The betting implications:
- Warriors team total likely too high
- Warriors spread may be too optimistic
- Under for full game total could be valuable
- Consider props for increased usage for Thompson, Wiggins

**Cavaliers vs. Pacers (Pacers lead 2-1)**
- No major injuries listed for these teams in the report

**Celtics vs. Knicks (Knicks lead 2-0)**
- Sam Hauser (Out) for Celtics - rotational player but not a key starter

**Thunder vs. Nuggets (Series tied 1-1)**
- No major injuries listed for these teams in the report

From the analysis, the clearest situation that might offer betting value is Warriors vs. Timberwolves with Curry's absence.

However, I need to be careful. The information about Curry being out is likely already factored into betting lines to some degree. The key question is whether the market has fully adjusted for his absence or if there might still be value.

Let's think about potential bets that might have value based on the information:

1. **Warriors Team Total Under**: Without Curry, the Warriors offense typically struggles significantly. If the market hasn't fully adjusted for this, there could be value in the under for Warriors team total.

2. **Timberwolves Spread**: With Curry out, the Timberwolves should have an advantage. If they're not heavily favored already, there could be value in taking them to cover.

3. **Full Game Total Under**: Warriors games without Curry often see lower scoring as their offense becomes less efficient and the pace can slow.

4. **Klay Thompson Over Points**: With Curry out, Thompson typically sees more shot attempts, though his efficiency might decrease with more defensive attention.

5. **Andrew Wiggins Over Points**: Similar to Thompson, Wiggins might see more offensive opportunities with Curry sidelined.

Without seeing the actual lines, it's hard to determine if these bets truly offer value. The market likely has already adjusted for Curry's absence to some degree.

Given the limited information and the initial statement that "No significant edges detected in today's NBA markets," I'll need to be cautious in my recommendations. I'll construct a set of recommended bets based on the analysis above, with reasonable stakes reflecting the uncertainty.

I also need to note that injuries listed with "Expected return: Sep 30" appear to be season-ending injuries or players who are out for the remainder of the current season (since September 30 would be before the next NBA season begins).

Let's create my RECOMMENDED BETS section with appropriate caution:
