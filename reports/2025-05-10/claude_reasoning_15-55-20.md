Let me analyze each of the games based on the provided betting lines, focusing on finding value bets while considering injuries and playoff dynamics.

## 1. New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/10/2025)

The odds for this game are extremely one-sided:
- Moneyline: Boston is a massive favorite (-6500 to -20000 range)
- Spread: Boston is favored by 20.5-21.5 points
- Totals: Line set at 218.5-220.5 points

This is an unusually large spread for an NBA playoff game, suggesting:
1. This could be an elimination game where Boston is up 3-0 in the series
2. New York might have significant injuries to key players
3. There is a massive talent disparity between these teams in their current state

Without specific injury information for the Knicks, it's difficult to fully evaluate. However, a 20+ point spread in a playoff game is extreme and suggests the Knicks may be severely undermanned. The extremely high moneyline odds make a Boston straight win bet impractical (too much risk for minimal return).

Potential value:
- The total points line is interesting. If the Knicks are severely undermanned, they might struggle to score, but Boston could run up the score. However, in blowouts, scoring often slows in the 4th quarter.
- The FanDuel spread of -21.5 for Boston at -128 seems slightly better than the DraftKings/BetMGM -20.5 options when considering the extreme nature of this matchup.

## 2. Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves (5/10/2025)

Key injury: Stephen Curry is out until May 13 with a Grade 1 left hamstring strain.

The odds indicate:
- Moneyline: Minnesota is favored (-218 to -225)
- Spread: Minnesota favored by 5.5 points consistently across bookmakers
- Totals: Line set at 200.5 points consistently

Analysis:
- Curry's absence is extremely significant for Golden State
- The 5.5-point spread is reasonable given Curry's absence
- The total of 200.5 seems low for an NBA game, reflecting Minnesota's strong defense and potentially slower pace without Curry

Potential value:
- Given Curry's absence, Minnesota -5.5 could have value
- The under 200.5 might be worth considering since Golden State's offense will be significantly hampered without Curry
- The consistency of the lines across bookmakers suggests the market has properly priced this game

## 3. Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/11/2025)

The odds indicate:
- Moneyline: OKC is favored (-225 to -255)
- Spread: OKC favored by 6-6.5 points
- Totals: Line set at 227-227.5 points

Analysis:
- There's a slight arbitrage opportunity on the spread with DraftKings offering Denver +6 (-115) and BetMGM offering OKC -6.5 (-105)
- The total points line is high, suggesting both teams have strong offenses or the game is expected to be played at a fast pace
- FanDuel has the best moneyline value for Denver at +210

Potential value:
- BetMGM's spread of OKC -6.5 (-105) offers slightly better value than the other books if you favor OKC
- The over at DraftKings (227, -110) is slightly more favorable than the other books if you expect a high-scoring game

## 4. Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers (5/11/2025)

The odds indicate:
- Moneyline: Cleveland is favored (-192 to -210)
- Spread: Cleveland favored by 4.5-5.5 points
- Totals: Line set at 230.5-231 points

Analysis:
- There's variation in the spread (4.5 to 5.5) across bookmakers, suggesting some uncertainty
- The total points line is high, indicating expectations for an offensive game
- DraftKings offers the best moneyline value for Cleveland at -192

Potential value:
- DraftKings spread of Cleveland -4.5 (-112) is most favorable if backing Cleveland
- BetMGM's spread of Indiana +5.5 (-115) offers the most points if backing Indiana
- The under at BetMGM (230.5, -105) is the best option if you believe the total is set too high

Now, let me formulate 3-5 concrete bet recommendations based on this analysis:

1. **Minnesota -5.5 vs Golden State (-110)**
   - With Curry out, Golden State's offense will struggle significantly
   - Minnesota's strong defense should be able to capitalize
   - 3 units

2. **OKC -6.5 vs Denver (-105 at BetMGM)**
   - This is slightly better value than the -6 line at other books
   - OKC has shown they can handle Denver's offensive threats
   - 2 units

3. **Cleveland -4.5 vs Indiana (-112 at DraftKings)**
   - Best spread value across bookmakers for Cleveland
   - Cleveland's defensive presence should contain Indiana's offense
   - 2 units

4. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (-110)**
   - Without Curry, Warriors offense will be limited
   - Timberwolves have a strong defensive identity
   - Game pace should be slower
   - 3 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (-105 at BetMGM)**
   - While both teams can score, this total seems slightly high
   - Playoff intensity often leads to tighter defense
   - 1 unit

Wait, I need to re-evaluate. Let me consider some additional factors and analyze each game more carefully.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
The extreme line (20.5-21.5 spread) suggests this is an elimination game with the Knicks likely missing multiple key players. Without specific injury information for the Knicks, it's difficult to assess whether there's value in these lines. 

The best value bet in an extreme mismatch often lies in the game total rather than the spread, as even heavily favored teams sometimes ease up once the game is well in hand. The BetMGM total of 220.5 points is higher than the other books (218.5), suggesting a potential opportunity on the under at BetMGM if we expect Boston to slow down in the fourth quarter of a blowout.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
With Curry out until May 13, the Warriors lose their primary offensive creator and scoring threat. This is reflected in the 5.5-point spread favoring Minnesota, but the effect on the total might be undervalued. The Warriors' offensive rating drops significantly without Curry, and Minnesota already has an elite defense. The 200.5 total is low by NBA standards, but could still offer value on the under.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
OKC being favored by 6-6.5 points against the defending champion Nuggets is notable. This suggests either:
1. Denver may be dealing with undisclosed injuries to key players
2. OKC has demonstrated dominance in recent head-to-head matchups
3. Home court advantage is being heavily weighted

The BetMGM spread of OKC -6.5 (-105) offers the best value if backing OKC. For Denver backers, DraftKings' +6 (-115) provides the most favorable line.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
The spread variance (4.5 to 5.5) across bookmakers is interesting. DraftKings' Cleveland -4.5 (-112) is the best value if backing Cleveland, while BetMGM's Indiana +5.5 (-115) offers the most points if backing Indiana. The high total (230.5-231) reflects both teams' offensive capabilities, but playoff games often feature increased defensive intensity.

Let me revise my bet recommendations based on this more detailed analysis:

1. **Under 220.5 in Knicks vs Celtics (BetMGM, -115)**
   - In extreme blowouts, pace often slows in the 4th quarter
   - BetMGM offers the highest total, creating value for the under
   - 2 units

2. **Minnesota -5.5 vs Golden State (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's defense should contain the Curry-less Warriors
   - 4 units (high confidence)

3. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (DraftKings/FanDuel, -110)**
   - Warriors offense is limited without Curry
   - Minnesota has elite defensive capabilities
   - 3 units

4. **Denver +6.5 vs OKC (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Defending champions Denver getting 6.5 points seems excessive
   - Playoff experience favors Denver in close games
   - 2 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Playoff intensity should boost defensive efficiency
   - BetMGM offers the best odds on this total
   - 2 units

Actually, looking at the Denver vs OKC odds again, I need to correct my recommendation. BetMGM lists Denver +6.5 at -115, but we want the best odds, which would be Denver +6 at DraftKings (-105). Let me adjust my recommendation for this game.

1. **Under 220.5 in Knicks vs Celtics (BetMGM, -115)**
   - In extreme blowouts, pace often slows in the 4th quarter
   - BetMGM offers the highest total, creating value for the under
   - 2 units

2. **Minnesota -5.5 vs Golden State (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's defense should contain the Curry-less Warriors
   - 4 units (high confidence)

3. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (DraftKings/FanDuel, -110)**
   - Warriors offense is limited without Curry
   - Minnesota has elite defensive capabilities
   - 3 units

4. **Denver +6 vs OKC (DraftKings, -105)**
   - Defending champions Denver getting 6 points at favorable odds
   - Playoff experience favors Denver in close games
   - 2 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Playoff intensity should boost defensive efficiency
   - BetMGM offers the best odds on this total
   - 2 units

Wait, I need to double-check the spread lines for Denver vs OKC one more time:

### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 6 (-115) | -6 (-105) |
| FanDuel | 6 (-105) | -6 (-115) |
| BetMGM | 6.5 (-115) | -6.5 (-105) |

Denver is the home team, and OKC is the away team. So for Denver +6, we would look at the "Home Team" column, and we see DraftKings offers Denver +6 at -115 and FanDuel offers Denver +6 at -105. So FanDuel has the better odds. For the largest spread, BetMGM offers Denver +6.5 at -115.

Let me correct my recommendation again:

4. **Denver +6.5 vs OKC (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Getting an extra half-point is worth the slightly worse odds
   - Defending champions Denver getting 6.5 points has value
   - 2 units

Wait, I've been reading this table incorrectly. Let me make sure I understand the format:

### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 6 (-115) | -6 (-105) |
| FanDuel | 6 (-105) | -6 (-115) |
| BetMGM | 6.5 (-115) | -6.5 (-105) |

If Denver is the home team, then a +6 for Denver would be shown as "6" in the home team column. So:
- DraftKings: Denver +6 (-115), OKC -6 (-105)
- FanDuel: Denver +6 (-105), OKC -6 (-115)
- BetMGM: Denver +6.5 (-115), OKC -6.5 (-105)

So the best value for betting on Denver would be FanDuel's Denver +6 (-105), as it offers better odds than DraftKings for the same spread. However, BetMGM's Denver +6.5 (-115) gives an extra half-point, which might be worth the slightly worse odds.

Let me go through each game one more time and make my final recommendations:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
Given the extreme spread (20.5-21.5), this appears to be a significant mismatch. The BetMGM total of 220.5 is higher than other books (218.5), potentially creating value on the under if the pace slows in a blowout.

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
Curry's absence is crucial. Minnesota is favored by 5.5 points across all books. The consistent low total of 200.5 reflects expectations of a defensive game with limited Warriors offense.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
OKC is favored by 6-6.5 points against the defending champion Nuggets. For Denver backers, the best value is FanDuel's +6 (-105), but BetMGM's +6.5 (-115) offers an extra half-point protection.

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
Cleveland is favored by 4.5-5.5 points. The spread variance creates opportunities: DraftKings' Cleveland -4.5 (-112) for Cleveland backers or BetMGM's Indiana +5.5 (-115) for Indiana supporters. The high total (230.5-231) might be exploitable with playoff defensive intensity.

Final bet recommendations:

1. **Under 220.5 in Knicks vs Celtics (BetMGM, -115)**
   - In extreme blowouts, pace often slows in the fourth quarter
   - BetMGM offers the highest total among bookmakers
   - 2 units

2. **Minnesota -5.5 vs Golden State (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's defense should contain Golden State
   - 4 units (high confidence)

3. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (DraftKings/FanDuel, -110)**
   - Warriors offense will struggle without Curry
   - Minnesota has elite defensive capabilities
   - 3 units

4. **Denver +6.5 vs OKC (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Extra half-point is valuable in playoff matchups
   - Defending champions getting 6.5 points offers value
   - 2 units

5. **Indiana +5.5 vs Cleveland (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Best spread available for Indiana backers
   - Pacers' offensive firepower can keep this game close
   - 2 units

I think these recommendations provide a balanced approach to the betting opportunities, with stakes adjusted based on confidence levels.

Actually, I've been reading all of these tables completely wrong. I need to clarify the format of the spread tables. Let me reanalyze:

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 20.5 (-110) | -20.5 (-120) |
| FanDuel | 21.5 (-104) | -21.5 (-128) |
| BetMGM | 20.5 (-118) | -20.5 (-110) |

I believe this is saying:
- Home team (Knicks) +20.5 at -110 (DraftKings)
- Away team (Celtics) -20.5 at -120 (DraftKings)

This makes more sense with the moneyline showing Boston as a huge favorite. Let me reanalyze all games with this understanding.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- Moneyline: Boston is heavily favored (-6500 to -20000)
- Spread: Boston is favored by 20.5-21.5 points
- Best value for Knicks spread: FanDuel +21.5 (-104)
- Best value for Celtics spread: BetMGM -20.5 (-110)
- Total points: BetMGM has the highest at 220.5

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Moneyline: Minnesota is favored (-218 to -225)
- Spread: Minnesota favored by 5.5 points consistently
- Curry is out until May 13
- Best value for Warriors spread: All books offer +5.5 (-110)
- Best value for Timberwolves spread: All books offer -5.5 (-110)
- Total points: Consistent at 200.5, BetMGM offers best under at -105

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Moneyline: OKC is favored (-225 to -255)
- Spread: OKC favored by 6-6.5 points
- Best value for Nuggets spread: FanDuel +6 (-105)
- Best value for Thunder spread: DraftKings -6 (-105)
- Total points: DraftKings has lowest at 227 (-110)

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Moneyline: Cleveland is favored (-192 to -210)
- Spread: Cleveland favored by 4.5-5.5 points
- Best value for Pacers spread: BetMGM +5.5 (-115)
- Best value for Cavaliers spread: DraftKings -4.5 (-112)
- Total points: BetMGM offers best under at 230.5 (-105)

With this clearer understanding, let me make my final bet recommendations:

1. **Minnesota -5.5 vs Golden State (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly handicaps Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's defense should contain Golden State
   - 4 units (high confidence)

2. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Warriors offense will struggle without Curry
   - Minnesota has elite defensive capabilities
   - BetMGM offers best odds for the under
   - 3 units

3. **Denver +6 vs OKC (FanDuel, -105)**
   - Best odds available for Denver spread
   - Defending champions should keep game competitive
   - 2 units

4. **Indiana +5.5 vs Cleveland (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Largest spread available for Indiana
   - Pacers' offensive firepower can keep this game close
   - 2 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Playoff intensity should boost defensive efficiency
   - BetMGM offers the best odds on this total
   - 1 unit

These recommendations provide a balanced approach with stakes reflecting confidence levels.

Actually, I need to double-check the tables one more time to make sure I have the correct home and away teams for each game:

1. New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
   - It appears Boston is the home team (given the moneyline odds)

2. Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
   - It appears Minnesota is the home team (given the moneyline odds)

3. Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
   - It appears Oklahoma City is the home team (given the moneyline odds)

4. Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
   - It appears Cleveland is the home team (given the moneyline odds)

I need to adjust my analysis based on this understanding of home/away teams.

Let me take one more look at the moneyline odds to confirm this:

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 1800 | -6500 |
| FanDuel | 3000 | -20000 |
| BetMGM | 1800 | -10000 |

Here, the Home Team column shows positive odds, while the Away Team shows negative odds. This suggests New York (underdog with positive odds) is the home team, and Boston (favorite with negative odds) is the away team.

Let me double-check the others:

## Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves
### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 180 | -218 |
| FanDuel | 188 | -225 |
| BetMGM | 185 | -225 |

Here, Golden State appears to be the home team (underdog with positive odds) and Minnesota the away team (favorite with negative odds).

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 185 | -225 |
| FanDuel | 210 | -255 |
| BetMGM | 200 | -250 |

Denver appears to be the home team (underdog with positive odds) and OKC the away team (favorite with negative odds).

## Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers
### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| FanDuel | 172 | -205 |
| DraftKings | 160 | -192 |
| BetMGM | 170 | -210 |

Indiana appears to be the home team (underdog with positive odds) and Cleveland the away team (favorite with negative odds).

So the actual matchups are:
1. New York Knicks (home) vs Boston Celtics (away)
2. Golden State Warriors (home) vs Minnesota Timberwolves (away)
3. Denver Nuggets (home) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (away)
4. Indiana Pacers (home) vs Cleveland Cavaliers (away)

Now I need to reanalyze the spread odds with this understanding:

## New York Knicks (home) vs Boston Celtics (away)
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 20.5 (-110) | -20.5 (-120) |
| FanDuel | 21.5 (-104) | -21.5 (-128) |
| BetMGM | 20.5 (-118) | -20.5 (-110) |

Knicks are +20.5/+21.5, Celtics are -20.5/-21.5

## Golden State Warriors (home) vs Minnesota Timberwolves (away)
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 5.5 (-110) | -5.5 (-110) |
| FanDuel | 5.5 (-110) | -5.5 (-110) |
| BetMGM | 5.5 (-110) | -5.5 (-110) |

Warriors are +5.5, Timberwolves are -5.5

## Denver Nuggets (home) vs Oklahoma City Thunder (away)
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | 6 (-115) | -6 (-105) |
| FanDuel | 6 (-105) | -6 (-115) |
| BetMGM | 6.5 (-115) | -6.5 (-105) |

Nuggets are +6/+6.5, Thunder are -6/-6.5

## Indiana Pacers (home) vs Cleveland Cavaliers (away)
### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team | Away Team |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| FanDuel | 5 (-108) | -5 (-112) |
| DraftKings | 4.5 (-108) | -4.5 (-112) |
| BetMGM | 5.5 (-115) | -5.5 (-105) |

Pacers are +4.5/+5/+5.5, Cavaliers are -4.5/-5/-5.5

With this clearer understanding, I can now make my final bet recommendations:

1. **Timberwolves -5.5 vs Warriors (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly weakens Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's elite defense should contain Golden State
   - 4 units (high confidence)

2. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Warriors offense will struggle without Curry
   - Minnesota's defensive capabilities should limit scoring
   - BetMGM offers the best odds for the under
   - 3 units

3. **Nuggets +6.5 vs Thunder (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Extra half-point is valuable in playoff matchups
   - Defending champions at home should keep game competitive
   - 2 units

4. **Pacers +5.5 vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Largest spread available for home underdog Indiana
   - Pacers' offensive firepower can keep this game close
   - 2 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Playoff intensity should boost defensive efficiency
   - BetMGM offers the best odds on this total
   - 1 unit

With clear understanding of the home and away teams, I'm confident these recommendations provide the best value based on the available odds and current circumstances (particularly Curry's injury).

Actually, I just want to double-check something one more time before finalizing my recommendations. I'm noticing that in the moneyline tables, the favorites consistently have negative odds and the underdogs have positive odds. This is standard betting notation.

However, in the spread tables, I'm interpreting something like "20.5 (-110)" to mean "+20.5 at -110 odds" and "-20.5 (-120)" to mean "-20.5 at -120 odds". This is also standard notation.

So for the Knicks vs. Celtics game, with the Knicks at home:
- The spread is Knicks +20.5 (-110) and Celtics -20.5 (-120) at DraftKings
- The moneyline is Knicks +1800 and Celtics -6500 at DraftKings

This makes logical sense since Boston is a big favorite.

Let me now ensure my bet recommendations reflect this understanding:

1. **Timberwolves -5.5 vs Warriors (any book, -110)**
   - Curry's absence significantly weakens Warriors' offense
   - Minnesota's elite defense should contain Golden State
   - 4 units (high confidence)

2. **Under 200.5 in Warriors vs Timberwolves (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Warriors offense will struggle without Curry
   - Minnesota's defensive capabilities should limit scoring
   - BetMGM offers the best odds for the under
   - 3 units

3. **Nuggets +6.5 vs Thunder (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Extra half-point is valuable in playoff matchups
   - Defending champions at home should keep game competitive
   - 2 units

4. **Pacers +5.5 vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -115)**
   - Largest spread available for home underdog Indiana
   - Pacers' offensive firepower can keep this game close
   - 2 units

5. **Under 230.5 in Pacers vs Cavaliers (BetMGM, -105)**
   - Playoff intensity should boost defensive efficiency
   - BetMGM offers the best odds on this total
   - 1 unit

These final recommendations provide balanced value across different games and bet types, with stake sizes reflecting my confidence level in each selection.
