## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -115 | 3 | BetMGM offers a crucial extra half-point that could be decisive in a playoff context. Denver has championship experience that typically keeps games competitive, even on the road. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +210 | 1 | FanDuel offers significantly better value than other books (+210 vs +185), suggesting market inefficiency. Denver's playoff experience and championship pedigree make them live underdogs. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -115 | 2 | The full point advantage at BetMGM compared to DraftKings (+4.5) provides significant value. Indiana's high-tempo offense typically keeps games within this margin. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 200.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best price on a matchup featuring two strong defensive teams. Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and more deliberate possessions, favoring the under. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Celtics +24.5 | -104 | 1 | If this is a legitimate playoff line, the extreme spread suggests value on Boston. Even significant blowouts rarely reach 25+ point margins, and FanDuel offers the best price. |

These recommendations target the clearest market inefficiencies while balancing risk through appropriate stake sizing. The highest confidence plays focus on the Nuggets spread and the Warriors-Timberwolves under, where the odds analysis suggests the strongest value propositions.
