## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +6.5 | -105 | 4 units | BetMGM offers a half-point advantage over other books for the defending champions who typically elevate their play in playoff settings. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -115 | 3 units | Full point advantage over DraftKings' line in what projects to be a competitive, high-scoring affair. Indiana's pace and scoring ability keeps them in games. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Warriors | +190 | 2 units | Golden State's championship pedigree and playoff experience makes them dangerous underdogs. Curry and Thompson have repeatedly shown they can elevate in postseason scenarios. |
| Pacers vs Cavaliers | Total | Under 230.5 | -105 | 3 units | BetMGM offers the best odds on this under. Despite both teams' offensive capabilities, playoff intensity typically leads to tighter defense and more half-court possessions. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +23.5 | -112 | 2 units | While likely a blowout, this massive spread provides significant cushion. FanDuel offers 3 more points than DraftKings/BetMGM, and even in extreme mismatches, NBA games rarely exceed 20+ point margins. |

These recommendations maximize value from line discrepancies between bookmakers while considering team contexts and playoff dynamics. Stakes reflect confidence levels in each selection.
