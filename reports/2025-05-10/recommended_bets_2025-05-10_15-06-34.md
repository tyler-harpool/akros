## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Knicks | +680 | 1 | Highest EV bet with 3.58% edge; Knicks have shown defensive prowess and are up 2-0 in series |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 206.5 | +100 | 3 | Strongest edge (4.22%) with positive odds; playoff intensity typically favors unders, especially in crucial Game 3s |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves -5.5 | -110 | 4 | Curry's absence severely limits Warriors' offense; Minnesota's defense can capitalize against a depleted GSW attack |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Over 227 | -110 | 2 | Both teams have shown offensive firepower in this series; Denver plays faster at home and should push pace in crucial Game 3 |

My highest confidence bet is on the Timberwolves covering against the Warriors without Curry. His absence fundamentally changes Golden State's offensive identity and ability to create spacing. The Knicks moneyline offers tremendous value at +680 despite the low probability, warranting a small stake given the edge percentage. The Knicks-Celtics under 206.5 at even money represents the largest statistical edge in the data and aligns with typical playoff patterns of tighter defensive games, especially in pivotal matchups.
