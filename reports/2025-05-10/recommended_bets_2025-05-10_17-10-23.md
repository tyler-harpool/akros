## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake (1-5 units) | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Cavaliers vs. Pacers | Series Winner | Pacers | +130 | 3 units | Pacers have momentum with a 2-1 lead and have exposed Cleveland's defensive weaknesses. Indiana's pace and scoring depth have consistently troubled the Cavs, who haven't found answers through three games. |
| Knicks vs. Celtics | Player Prop | Jalen Brunson Over 30.5 Points | -110 | 4 units | Brunson has scored 30+ in both games so far and is the clear offensive focal point. Boston hasn't found an answer defensively, and his usage rate remains extremely high (34%+) in the playoffs. |
| Thunder vs. Nuggets | Game Total | Under 217.5 (Game 3) | -108 | 3 units | Both teams have tightened defensively as the series has progressed. First two games averaged 214 points, and with adjustments being made, expect even more defensive intensity in a crucial Game 3. |
| Timberwolves vs. Warriors | Player Prop | Anthony Edwards Over 27.5 Points | -115 | 3 units | Edwards has emerged as Minnesota's go-to scorer, averaging 31.5 PPG in the series. His confidence is soaring, and the Warriors have struggled to contain his explosiveness and three-level scoring ability. |

The recommended bets factor in current series dynamics, statistical trends, and the psychological elements of playoff basketball. Each selection represents a spot where the market appears to have either overreacted or underreacted to recent performance.
