## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 4 | FanDuel offers a significant half-point advantage over DraftKings' -3 line with better odds. This key number difference substantially increases win probability. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -108 | 3 | Half-point advantage compared to DraftKings' -5 spread with better vig, allowing for wins on bets that would push at the other book. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors | Spread | Warriors +3.5 | -106 | 3 | FanDuel offers better odds than standard -110 vig, creating value in a matchup where the Warriors typically keep games competitive. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks | Totals | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 | FanDuel's total is a full point higher than DraftKings (225.5), creating value on the under as this matchup historically plays to tempo control. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs | Moneyline | Thunder ML | -405 | 2 | FanDuel offers significantly better odds than DraftKings' -455 for the heavily favored Thunder against the rebuilding Spurs. |

These recommendations capitalize on line discrepancies between bookmakers while prioritizing value positions on spreads where we gain the advantage of key half-point differences.
