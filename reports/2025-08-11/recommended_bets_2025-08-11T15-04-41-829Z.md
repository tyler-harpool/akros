## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 | 3 | Significant 1-point spread discrepancy between bookmakers indicates value on Dallas at the larger number. FanDuel's line seems overly pessimistic compared to DraftKings' assessment. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 2 | Better value than DraftKings' -3 line. Home court advantage for the Knicks should be enough to cover this smaller spread with more favorable odds. |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Total | Over 224.5 | -110 | 3 | Both teams feature young, athletic rosters that should push the pace. This total is 1 point lower at DraftKings than FanDuel, providing additional value. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -108 | 4 | Strong value for the home favorite at FanDuel compared to DraftKings' -5 line. Denver's home court advantage should be significant in this divisional matchup. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Moneyline | Rockets | 104 | 1 | With such a tight spread (-1.5), the plus-money value on Houston makes this a worthwhile underdog play at FanDuel's odds. |

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward while exploiting the line discrepancies between bookmakers. As game day approaches and lineup information becomes available, further adjustments may be warranted.
