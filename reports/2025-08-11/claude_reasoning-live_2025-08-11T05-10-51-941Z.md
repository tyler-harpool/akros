Let me analyze this data for live in-game NBA betting. I need to focus on the games currently in progress and identify the best betting opportunities.

First, I need to determine which games are actually LIVE right now based on the dates provided:

- Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (10/22/2025, 12:30:00 AM)
- Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (10/22/2025, 3:00:00 AM)
- New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/26/2025, 12:00:00 AM)
- Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (12/26/2025, 12:00:00 AM)
- Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025, 12:00:00 AM)
- Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025, 12:00:00 AM)
- Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/26/2025, 12:00:00 AM)

Wait - the dates here are in the future (in 2025). This makes analyzing "live in-game" betting a bit challenging since these games haven't actually started yet. However, I'll proceed as if we're analyzing pre-game odds with the understanding that these would be the initial odds before the games begin, and we're identifying potential value.

Let me analyze each game:

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets
- Thunder are heavy favorites (-265/-255 ML, -6.5 spread)
- Total points around 224.5-225.5
- No lineup data available

### Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors
- Lakers are moderate favorites (-162/-166 ML, -3.5 spread)
- Total points around 224.5-225.5
- No lineup data available

### New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Knicks are moderate favorites (-155/-142 ML, -3/-2.5 spread)
- Total points at 229.5
- No lineup data available

### Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks
- Warriors are moderate favorites (-166/-198 ML, -3.5/-4.5 spread)
- Total points around 225.5-226.5
- Notable spread difference between bookmakers (1 point)
- No lineup data available

### Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Nuggets are solid favorites (-205/-190 ML, -5/-4.5 spread)
- Total points around 229-230.5
- No lineup data available

### Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets
- Lakers are slight favorites (-118/-122 ML, -1/-1.5 spread)
- Total points around 223.5-224.5
- Very close matchup according to odds
- No lineup data available

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs
- Thunder are heavy favorites (-455/-405 ML, -9.5 spread)
- Total points around 227-228.5
- No lineup data available

I need to find potential betting value. Let me look for:
1. Differences between bookmakers that might indicate value
2. Line movements that suggest smart money
3. Matchups where the odds might not fully reflect team capabilities

Key observations:

1. **Knicks vs Cavaliers**: FanDuel has Knicks at -142 while DraftKings has -155. This suggests potential value on the Knicks at FanDuel if you believe they should be favorites.

2. **Warriors vs Mavericks**: Major difference in spread (DraftKings -3.5 vs FanDuel -4.5) and moneyline (DraftKings -166 vs FanDuel -198). This suggests value on Warriors at DraftKings if you believe they should be stronger favorites.

3. **Nuggets vs Timberwolves**: FanDuel has Nuggets at -190 while DraftKings has -205, and spread differential (DraftKings -5 vs FanDuel -4.5). This suggests slight value on Nuggets at FanDuel if you believe they should be stronger favorites.

4. **Lakers vs Rockets**: This is projected as the closest game. Both books have Lakers as slight favorites. No significant arbitrage opportunity.

5. **Thunder vs Spurs**: FanDuel has Thunder at -405 while DraftKings has -455. This suggests value on Thunder at FanDuel if you believe they should be stronger favorites.

Without lineup data, injury information, or recent team performance, it's challenging to make highly confident recommendations. However, I can identify potential value based on the odds discrepancies.

For my recommendations, I'll focus on:
1. The most significant odds discrepancies between bookmakers
2. Games where the spread and moneyline suggest different narratives
3. Totals markets that might present value

Let me now create the RECOMMENDED BETS section with the most promising opportunities:
