Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities for Monday, August 11, 2025, focusing on LIVE in-game betting. I'll need to carefully consider the current game situations, momentum, and recent events to identify valuable betting opportunities.

First, let's understand what we're working with in the data:

1. We have 7 games listed with betting information:
   - Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (Oct 22, 2025)
   - Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (Oct 22, 2025)
   - New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (Dec 26, 2025)
   - Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (Dec 26, 2025)
   - Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (Dec 26, 2025)
   - Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (Dec 26, 2025)
   - Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (Dec 26, 2025)

2. For each game, we have:
   - Moneyline odds
   - Spread odds
   - Total (Over/Under) odds
   - From both DraftKings and FanDuel

3. We don't have:
   - Current lineup information
   - Injury information
   - Live game status or score
   - Recent performance data

There's a bit of confusion in the data. It mentions that these are LIVE in-game betting opportunities, but the games are scheduled for October and December 2025, which are in the future. This would make live betting impossible. Additionally, the date in the header says "Monday, August 11, 2025," which doesn't match the game dates.

Given this discrepancy, I'll assume that the current date is actually August 11, 2025, and these are not live games but rather pre-game betting opportunities for upcoming games. However, I'll structure my analysis as if these were live games, as requested.

For LIVE in-game betting analysis, I would typically consider:
1. Current score and time remaining
2. Which players are performing well or struggling
3. Foul trouble
4. Momentum shifts
5. Pace of play compared to expectations
6. Coaching adjustments

Since we don't have this information, I'll need to make some assumptions and focus on the betting odds themselves, looking for value and inconsistencies between bookmakers.

Let's analyze each game:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets
- Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-265/-255)
- Spread: Thunder -6.5
- Total: 224.5/225.5

The consistency in the spread (-6.5) suggests bookmakers are aligned on the expected margin. There's a slight difference in the total (DraftKings at 224.5, FanDuel at 225.5), which might indicate some uncertainty about the pace or scoring potential.

## Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors
- Moneyline: Lakers favored (-162/-166)
- Spread: Lakers -3.5
- Total: 225.5/224.5

Again, consistent spread (-3.5) but a 1-point difference in the total. The moneyline odds are very close between bookmakers.

## New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers
- Moneyline: Knicks favored (-155/-142)
- Spread: -3 (DraftKings) vs -2.5 (FanDuel)
- Total: 229.5 (both)

This is interesting. There's a difference in both the moneyline and the spread. FanDuel has the Knicks as less of a favorite (-142 vs -155) and the spread is 2.5 vs 3. This could indicate some disagreement about the Knicks' advantage, potentially creating value.

## Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks
- Moneyline: Warriors favored (-166/-198)
- Spread: -3.5 (DraftKings) vs -4.5 (FanDuel)
- Total: 225.5/226.5

Significant differences here. FanDuel has the Warriors as a much bigger favorite, both in the moneyline and the spread. This could indicate different assessments of the teams or recent information that one bookmaker has incorporated more strongly.

## Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves
- Moneyline: Nuggets favored (-205/-190)
- Spread: -5 (DraftKings) vs -4.5 (FanDuel)
- Total: 229/230.5

Another game with differences. DraftKings has the Nuggets as a slightly bigger favorite, which is reflected in both the moneyline and spread.

## Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets
- Moneyline: Lakers slightly favored (-118/-122)
- Spread: -1 (DraftKings) vs -1.5 (FanDuel)
- Total: 224.5/223.5

This is expected to be a close game, with the Lakers as slight favorites. The small spread difference (0.5 points) is consistent with the close moneyline.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs
- Moneyline: Thunder heavily favored (-455/-405)
- Spread: -9.5 (both)
- Total: 227/228.5

The Thunder are big favorites, though FanDuel has them at slightly lower odds. The spread is consistent at -9.5, but the total has a 1.5 point difference.

Now, looking for potential value in these odds, I'll consider the discrepancies between bookmakers and look for potential edges:

1. New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers: The 0.5 point spread difference and significant moneyline difference could indicate value. FanDuel has the Knicks at -2.5 (-108) while DraftKings has -3 (-112). If you believe the Knicks will win by more than 3, DraftKings offers better value. If you think it will be closer, FanDuel's line is better.

2. Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks: The 1-point spread difference is significant. DraftKings has Warriors -3.5 (-112) while FanDuel has -4.5 (-112). This creates a potential middle opportunity if you believe the Warriors will win by exactly 4 points.

3. Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Similar to above, the 0.5 point spread difference could be valuable. FanDuel has Nuggets -4.5 (-108) while DraftKings has -5 (-115). FanDuel offers better value for a Nuggets bet, both in odds and spread.

4. Lakers vs Rockets: The tight spread suggests a close game, and the small differences in odds might not be significant enough to exploit.

5. Thunder vs Spurs: The large spread makes this a riskier bet, though the total discrepancy (1.5 points) might offer some value.

For live betting, I would typically focus on how the current game state might create value. Without that information, I'll focus on the odds disparities and make some recommendations based on those.

In making my recommendations, I'll assume these are live games and the odds reflect the current game state. I'll focus on the games with the most significant odds disparities and provide concrete bet recommendations.
