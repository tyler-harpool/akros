## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 3 | FanDuel's -2.5 offers half-point value over DraftKings' -3, crucial in what appears to be a competitive game. The -108 price point provides better value than standard -110 juice. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Moneyline | Mavericks | 166 | 2 | Significant odds discrepancy between books suggests market uncertainty. FanDuel's +166 offers substantial underdog value compared to DraftKings' +140. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -108 | 3 | FanDuel offers both a more favorable spread (-4.5 vs -5) and better odds (-108 vs -115) than DraftKings, creating clear value on the Nuggets. |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 | 2 | 1.5 point difference between books on the total suggests value on FanDuel's higher number. Thunder's defensive presence likely controlling game pace. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 1 | In this projected close game, getting the Lakers at -1 (DraftKings) versus -1.5 (FanDuel) provides valuable half-point insurance in what looks to be a tight finish. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as these odds will continue to shift based on game developments. The recommendations focus on exploiting current pricing discrepancies between major sportsbooks.
