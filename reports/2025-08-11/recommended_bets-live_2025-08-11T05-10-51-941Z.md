## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Spread | Warriors -3.5 | -112 | 3 | Significant gap between DK (-3.5) and FD (-4.5) suggests value on the lower spread. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Moneyline | Rockets | 104 | 2 | Nearly even matchup with positive odds for Houston offers good value for a competitive game. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 | Better value on FanDuel (-190) vs DraftKings (-205) for the home favorite Nuggets. |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Total | Under 227 | -108 | 2 | Value on the under at DraftKings with favorable -108 odds compared to FanDuel's higher total (228.5). |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -108 | 2 | Half-point advantage on FanDuel's spread (-2.5 vs -3) with reasonable juice. |

Remember that when these games actually go live, in-game odds will shift quickly based on score, momentum, and player performance. These pre-game values provide a starting point, but live betting requires monitoring how the games unfold and adjusting accordingly.
