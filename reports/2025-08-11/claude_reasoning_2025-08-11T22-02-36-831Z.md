Let me analyze the provided betting opportunities for these NBA games. I'll need to be careful since I don't have much contextual information about the teams' current performance, injuries, or recent trends since these games are projected for future dates (October and December 2025).

First, let's organize what we know:

## Games on October 22, 2025:
1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (12:30 AM)
2. Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (3:00 AM)

## Games on December 26, 2025:
3. New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers
4. Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks
5. Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves
6. Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets
7. Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs

Since we don't have lineup data, injuries, or team statistics, I'll need to focus on the betting odds themselves to look for potential inefficiencies and value. I'll analyze each game by comparing the odds between bookmakers and looking for discrepancies that might indicate value.

### 1. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (Oct 22)

Now let's identify some potential betting opportunities based on the odds discrepancies:

1. **Knicks -2.5 (-108) at FanDuel** vs. Cavaliers: This seems like good value compared to DraftKings' -3 line.

2. **Nuggets -4.5 (-108) at FanDuel** vs. Timberwolves: Again, getting a better line than DraftKings' -5.

3. **Thunder ML (-405) at FanDuel** vs. Spurs: If you're looking to bet on a heavy favorite, FanDuel offers better odds than DraftKings.

4. **Warriors +3.5 (-106) at FanDuel** vs. Lakers (Oct 22): Better odds than the standard -110.

5. **Totals middle opportunities**: For several games, there's a 1-point or 1.5-point difference in the totals between bookmakers, potentially creating middle opportunities:
   - Thunder/Rockets: Over 224.5 (DK) and Under 225.5 (FD)
   - Lakers/Warriors: Over 224.5 (FD) and Under 225.5 (DK)
   - Warriors/Mavs: Over 225.5 (DK) and Under 226.5 (FD)
   - Nuggets/Wolves: Over 229 (DK) and Under 230.5 (FD)
   - Lakers/Rockets: Over 223.5 (FD) and Under 224.5 (DK)
   - Thunder/Spurs: Over 227 (DK) and Under 228.5 (FD)

Let me now select the best 3-5 recommendations based on this analysis and create a properly formatted table for the "RECOMMENDED BETS" section. Since we lack team performance data, I'll focus on the odds inefficiencies and give more weight to spread discrepancies.

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. New York Knicks -2.5 (-108) at FanDuel
   - Game: New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers
   - Bet Type: Spread
   - Selection: Knicks -2.5
   - Odds: -108
   - Stake: 4 units
   - Reasoning: Half-point advantage over DraftKings' -3 line with better odds.

2. Denver Nuggets -4.5 (-108) at FanDuel
   - Game: Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves
   - Bet Type: Spread
   - Selection: Nuggets -4.5
   - Odds: -108
   - Stake: 4 units
   - Reasoning: Half-point advantage over DraftKings' -5 line with better odds.

3. Golden State Warriors +3.5 (-106) at FanDuel
   - Game: Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors
   - Bet Type: Spread
   - Selection: Warriors +3.5
   - Odds: -106
   - Stake: 3 units
   - Reasoning: Better odds than the standard -110, creating slight value.

4. "Middle" on Thunder/Rockets
   - Game: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets
   - Bet Type: Totals
   - Selection: Over 224.5 (DK) and Under 225.5 (FD)
   - Odds: -110 both
   - Stake: 2 units each
   - Reasoning: Opportunity to win both bets if the total lands at exactly 225 points.

5. Cavaliers +130 at DraftKings
   - Game: New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers
   - Bet Type: Moneyline
   - Selection: Cavaliers +130
   - Odds: +130
   - Stake: 2 units
   - Reasoning: Better underdog value than FanDuel's +120 for the same team.

These recommendations are primarily based on finding inefficiencies in the odds between bookmakers rather than team performance, since we lack contextual information about the teams' current form, injuries, etc. The stakes reflect my confidence based solely on the odds discrepancies.

Let me format this into a proper table for the "RECOMMENDED BETS" section.
