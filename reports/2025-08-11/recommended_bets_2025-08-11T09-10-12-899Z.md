## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Moneyline | Warriors | -166 | 4 | Significant 32-point odds advantage over FanDuel (-198); Warriors typically strong at home against Dallas |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 | 3 | Better value than DraftKings (-155); Knicks projected to have home court advantage at MSG |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Spread | Warriors +3.5 | -106 | 3 | Best available odds on FanDuel for this spread in what projects to be a competitive Western Conference matchup |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -105 | 2 | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's line (4.5) with favorable odds; these divisional rivals typically play close games |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Total | Under 227 | -108 | 2 | 1.5 points lower than FanDuel's line (228.5); Thunder's defensive identity should contain the younger Spurs team |

These recommendations balance value from odds discrepancies with fundamental matchup analysis. Given the future dates of these games, I've focused on structured advantages in the betting markets rather than team-specific factors that could change significantly by game time.
