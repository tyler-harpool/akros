## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Moneyline | Thunder | -150 | 3 units | If Rockets build early lead, bet Thunder ML once odds improve from pre-game -270 to around -150, representing significant value on the superior team after market overreaction |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Spread | Lakers | +2.5 (-110) | 2 units | If Warriors lead by 6+ points in first half, take Lakers at positive spread – market often overreacts to early Warriors shooting runs that aren't sustainable |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Totals | Under 228.5 | -110 | 2 units | If first quarter features hot shooting and pace exceeds expectations, take under on adjusted live total as defensive intensity typically increases and shooting regression occurs |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Moneyline | Team trailing at half | +140 | 3 units | In this pick'em matchup, if either team builds 7+ point halftime lead, back trailing team at improved odds – close matchups frequently feature second-half comebacks |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Nuggets | +3.5 (-110) | 4 units | If Timberwolves build early lead and Nuggets (pre-game favorite) fall behind, take Denver at plus points once spread moves beyond +3, representing strong value on the superior team |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making. Have these scenarios in mind and be ready to act when the conditions materialize during the games.
