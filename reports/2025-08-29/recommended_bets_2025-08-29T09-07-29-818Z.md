## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Spurs -1 | -102 | 3 units | Moneyline shows even matchup (-110 both sides) but spread favors Spurs with better juice (-102 vs -118). Line movement suggests sharp money on Spurs, creating value on the home team. |
| Chicago Bulls vs Detroit Pistons (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Bulls | +110 | 2 units | Bulls as home underdogs offer significant value. Market typically undervalues home court in perceived even matchups. The +110 implies 47.6% win probability, which underestimates home advantage. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/25) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 units | Warriors as home underdogs on Thanksgiving night is a prime opportunity. Holiday games tend to favor home teams, and this line doesn't adequately account for the Warriors' home court edge. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/25/25) | Total | Under 229.5 | -108 | 4 units | Christmas Day games often feature tighter defense and slower pace. These traditionally defensive-minded teams have an inflated total due to holiday public betting on overs. Strong historical trend supports Christmas unders. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/25) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 units | Value exists in the DraftKings line (-1) compared to FanDuel (-1.5). This half-point difference is significant in a projected close game and provides insurance against a 1-point Lakers win. |
