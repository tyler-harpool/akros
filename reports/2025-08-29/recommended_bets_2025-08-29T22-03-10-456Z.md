## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Timberwolves | +180 | 3 | Significant pricing discrepancy between sportsbooks (FanDuel has it at +160), offering value on the underdog at DraftKings |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Spurs +1 | -102 | 4 | True pick'em on moneyline (-110 each way) but Spurs getting a point with favorable juice creates mathematical advantage |
| Houston Rockets vs Golden State Warriors (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 | Warriors rarely home underdogs, getting a point despite tight moneyline pricing suggests value |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder (1/19/2026) | Spread | Cavaliers +1 | -105 | 3 | Even matchup on moneyline but spread favors Thunder, creating inconsistency that benefits Cavaliers backers |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 227 | -112 | 2 | FanDuel has this total at 228.5 points, suggesting potential value on the over at DraftKings' lower number |
