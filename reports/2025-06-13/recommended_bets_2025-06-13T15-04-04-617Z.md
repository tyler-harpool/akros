## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -115 | 3 | Home court advantage plus balanced scoring attack should keep the game competitive; extra half-point provides valuable insurance compared to +6 elsewhere |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 226.5 | -105 | 2 | Thunder's defensive strengths (Dort on perimeter, Holmgren protecting rim) could disrupt Pacers' flow; best price available on this total |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +200 | 1 | Small value play on home underdog with sufficient talent to potentially upset; Haliburton-Siakam-Turner trio can challenge Thunder |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -218 | 3 | Best available price on the Thunder who have superior star power with SGA and Holmgren; safer play than the spread |

The most confident recommendations are the Pacers spread and the Thunder moneyline, which provide complementary coverage of the most likely outcomes while capturing the best available odds across sportsbooks.
