Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for Friday, June 13, 2025.

## Game Context Assessment

First, I need to understand the context of this game:
- This is a regular season NBA game (not specified as playoffs)
- We have full projected starting lineups for both teams
- No injuries are listed in the provided information
- The Thunder are favored in this matchup (negative moneyline odds, favored on the spread)

## Team Analysis

### Oklahoma City Thunder
- Led by star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at PG
- Chet Holmgren at center provides rim protection and spacing
- Luguentz Dort is a strong defender
- Starting lineup appears to be their standard lineup
- Limited bench information provided (only N. Topic mentioned)

### Indiana Pacers
- Tyrese Haliburton leading at PG
- Strong frontcourt with Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner
- Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard rounding out the starting lineup
- Slightly more bench information with I. Jackson and J. Walker listed

## Odds Analysis

### Moneyline
- Thunder: Range from -230 to -245 (favorites)
- Pacers: Range from +190 to +200 (underdogs)
- Best value for Thunder: DraftKings (-230)
- Best value for Pacers: FanDuel (+200)

### Spread
- Thunder favored by 6 to 6.5 points
- Most books have 6 points (-110 both sides)
- BetMGM has 6.5 points with slight odds adjustment (-105 for Thunder -6.5, -115 for Pacers +6.5)
- The half-point hook at BetMGM is significant

### Totals
- Range from 226.5 to 227.5 points
- FanDuel has highest at 227.5 (-110 both sides)
- DraftKings at 227 (-110 both sides)
- BetMGM lowest at 226.5 with slight odds adjustment (-115 Over, -105 Under)

## Implied Probabilities

Let me calculate the implied probabilities from the moneyline odds:

Thunder:
- FanDuel (-245): 245/(245+100) = 0.7101 or 71.01%
- DraftKings (-230): 230/(230+100) = 0.6970 or 69.70%
- BetMGM (-235): 235/(235+100) = 0.7015 or 70.15%

Pacers:
- FanDuel (+200): 100/(200+100) = 0.3333 or 33.33%
- DraftKings (+190): 100/(190+100) = 0.3448 or 34.48%
- BetMGM (+195): 100/(195+100) = 0.3390 or 33.90%

There's a slight overround (the sum of implied probabilities exceeds 100%), which is normal for sportsbooks.

## Historical Matchup Analysis

Unfortunately, I don't have specific historical matchup data between these teams in the provided information. In a real analysis, I would consider:
- Head-to-head records
- Recent form for both teams
- Home/away performance statistics
- Pace and style matchup considerations

## Key Matchups

Based on the provided lineups:

1. Gilgeous-Alexander vs Haliburton - Elite point guard matchup
2. Holmgren vs Turner - Battle of skilled big men who can shoot from outside
3. Siakam vs Williams - Experience vs youth at the power forward position
4. Bench depth (limited information provided)

## Finding Value

Without specific statistical edges mentioned in the data, I'll need to rely on lineup analysis and odds comparison to find potential value.

1. **Spread Consideration**: 
   - The half-point hook at BetMGM (6.5 instead of 6) is significant
   - Taking Pacers +6.5 (-115) at BetMGM might have value compared to +6 (-110) elsewhere
   - The extra half-point can be crucial in a close game

2. **Total Points Consideration**:
   - The 1-point range (226.5 to 227.5) suggests some disagreement among bookmakers
   - BetMGM offers the lowest total at 226.5 with a slight discount on the Under (-105)
   - FanDuel has the highest total at 227.5 (-110)

3. **Moneyline Consideration**:
   - Pacers at home as underdogs might present value at +200 (FanDuel)
   - However, this is only if we believe they have better than a 33.33% chance to win

Without specific statistical edges mentioned or detailed injury reports, I need to make some assumptions based on the starting lineups and odds.

## Betting Recommendations

Based on the available information, here are the bets that appear to offer the most value:

1. **Pacers +6.5 (-115) at BetMGM**
   - The extra half-point provides significant value compared to +6 elsewhere
   - Home underdogs tend to perform better than expected in the NBA
   - Strong lineup with Haliburton, Siakam, and Turner should keep them competitive

2. **Under 227.5 (-110) at FanDuel**
   - Taking the highest available total gives the most value for an Under bet
   - Both teams feature strong defensive players (Dort, Holmgren, Turner)
   - Half-point advantage compared to DraftKings line

3. **Pacers Moneyline (+200) at FanDuel**
   - As a value play with potential for higher returns
   - Home court advantage can be significant
   - If the Pacers can control the pace with Haliburton, they have a chance to pull the upset

4. **Thunder -6 (-110) at FanDuel/DraftKings**
   - Better value than -6.5 at BetMGM
   - Thunder have the superior talent with SGA leading the way
   - Avoid the hook while still backing the favorite

For confidence levels and stakes (1-5 units):
- Pacers +6.5 (-115): 4 units (highest confidence)
- Under 227.5 (-110): 3 units
- Pacers Moneyline (+200): 1 unit (low confidence, value play)
- Thunder -6 (-110): 2 units

Now let me convert this analysis into specific bet recommendations as requested.
