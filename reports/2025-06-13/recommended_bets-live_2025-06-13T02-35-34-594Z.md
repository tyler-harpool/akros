## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -218 | 3 | Better value at DraftKings than FanDuel for the favored team; Thunder's defensive efficiency typically translates well on the road |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6 | -108 | 2 | Slightly better pricing at FanDuel; Pacers tend to keep games competitive at home with their pace of play |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 225.5 | -108 | 2 | Thunder's defensive identity can slow Pacers' preferred tempo; under is slightly better priced than over |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Thunder -3.5 | +125* | 1 | *Estimated alternate line value; smaller spread at plus money provides strong middle opportunity |
