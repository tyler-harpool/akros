## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 3 units | BetMGM offers best spread (+6.5 vs +6) and odds. Pacers' home court advantage and balanced starting five should keep this competitive. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 225.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Good value at -105, and both teams have elite rim protectors (Holmgren/Turner). Thunder likely to control tempo on the road. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +190 (FanDuel/BetMGM) | 1 unit | Home underdog offering nearly 2:1 return. Pacers' balanced attack led by Haliburton gives them better than the implied 34% win probability. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Player Prop | Haliburton Assists | Over 9.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Against aggressive OKC defense, Haliburton likely to focus on distribution. His pick-and-roll/pop with Turner and Siakam should generate numerous assist opportunities. |

These recommendations prioritize value identified through line shopping and matchup analysis. The strongest play is the Pacers +6.5 points, which gives us the extra half-point protection at better odds than other books are offering for fewer points.
