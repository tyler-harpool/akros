# LIVE NBA Betting Analysis: Pacers vs. Thunder (6/14/2025)

I'm analyzing live in-game betting opportunities for the Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder matchup. With limited game state information provided, I'll focus on identifying value through odds comparison and implied probabilities.

## Current Market Assessment

Based on the betting lines, Oklahoma City is a clear favorite with a 6-6.5 point spread and moneyline odds implying approximately a 68-69% win probability. The total points consensus is 225.5 across all major sportsbooks.

Without current score or time remaining information, my analysis must focus on identifying the best available odds for each market position. The slight line variations between sportsbooks create small arbitrage opportunities that can be valuable in live betting scenarios.

### Key Observations:
- BetMGM offers the best spread value for Pacers backers at +6.5 (-102)
- DraftKings has the most favorable Thunder moneyline at -218
- The total points line is consistent across books, with minimal vig differences
