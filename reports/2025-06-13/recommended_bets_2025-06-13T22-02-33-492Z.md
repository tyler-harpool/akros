## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -115 | 4 units | The crucial half-point hook at BetMGM provides significant value compared to +6 elsewhere. Home underdogs with a talented lineup should keep this competitive. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 227.5 | -110 | 3 units | Taking the highest available total at FanDuel maximizes value. Both teams feature quality defensive players (Dort, Holmgren, Turner) who could slow the scoring pace. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +200 | 1 unit | Strong value play with the Pacers at home. If Haliburton controls the pace and their frontcourt plays well, they have upset potential that exceeds the 33.3% implied probability. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -6 | -110 | 2 units | For those looking to back the favorite, taking -6 (FanDuel/DraftKings) instead of -6.5 provides better value and avoids the dangerous hook in what could be a close finish. |

These recommendations balance the value identified in the current betting markets while accounting for team strengths and matchup dynamics.
