## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 2 | The spread is relatively large at 9.5 points. If the Pacers can keep it competitive early, this line provides solid value for a team that typically plays at a fast pace and can score in bunches to stay within striking distance. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 | 1 | While Thunder should win, FanDuel's +330 offers slight value over DraftKings for an opportunistic underdog play if Pacers show early momentum. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 230.5 | -110 | 3 | Both teams rank among the faster-paced teams in the NBA. The FanDuel line at 230.5 (vs. DraftKings' 231) provides slightly better value for an over bet in what should be an up-tempo contest. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 231 | -108 | 2 | If defense intensifies as the game progresses, DraftKings offers the better line for under bettors at 231 with slightly better odds at -108. |

For more effective live betting analysis, I would need current score, time remaining, lineup information, and recent momentum shifts during the game. This would allow for more precise recommendations based on how the game is actually unfolding.
