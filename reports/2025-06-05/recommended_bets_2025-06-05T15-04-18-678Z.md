## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +10 | -115 (DraftKings) | 3 | Double-digit spreads often provide value; Pacers have enough offensive firepower to keep this within single digits |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 2 | Thunder's elite defense should slow Pacers' transition offense; expect OKC to control tempo |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 | Shopping for the best line; half-point could be crucial in a game projected to be decided by approximately 10 points |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +350 (FanDuel) | 1 | Small value play with solid return; Pacers can pull upset if Haliburton excels and they dictate pace |

This balanced approach provides multiple angles to attack this matchup, with the majority of our allocation focused on the Pacers covering the substantial spread while making a small play on their upset potential at attractive odds.
