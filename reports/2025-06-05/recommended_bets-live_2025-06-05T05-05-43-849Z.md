## RECOMMENDED BETS
Given the limitations of not having actual live game data, I can only provide hypothetical recommendations based on typical live betting scenarios that might emerge in this matchup:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Spread | Pacers +12.5 | -110 | 2 | *Hypothetical scenario: If Thunder built a larger lead than pre-game spread, but Pacers showing signs of offensive rhythm* |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Total | Under 235.5 | -110 | 2 | *Hypothetical scenario: If pace slowed in 2nd quarter with defensive adjustments* |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Live Quarter | Thunder -2.5 (4th Qtr) | -108 | 3 | *Hypothetical scenario: If Thunder's closing lineup showing superior execution in close games* |

**Note:** These are hypothetical recommendations only. For actual live betting recommendations, I would need current game state information including score, time remaining, and recent performance metrics.
