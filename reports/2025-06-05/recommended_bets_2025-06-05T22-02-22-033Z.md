## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +10 | -112 | 3 units | The extra half-point at DraftKings provides valuable cushion in what could be a competitive game despite the Thunder's advantages. The Pacers' uptempo style can keep games closer than expected. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 230.5 | -108 | 3 units | The Thunder's elite defense should contain the Pacers enough to stay under this total. DraftKings offers better value with both a higher line and better odds than FanDuel. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +360 | 1 unit | While a Thunder win is more likely, the Pacers have upset potential with Haliburton and Siakam capable of big performances. This offers excellent value at +360 for a small stake. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -114 | 2 units | If backing the favorite, FanDuel's -9.5 spread requires covering less points than the -10 at DraftKings, providing better value despite slightly worse odds. |

These recommendations focus on finding the best value across different bookmakers while accounting for the game context and likely outcomes.
