## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 units | Pacers' offensive firepower with Haliburton/Siakam/Turner should keep this competitive; their superior bench depth becomes valuable in a game with this many possessions |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 230.5 | -110 | 3 units | Both teams have efficient offensive players at multiple positions; Pacers' traditionally fast pace combined with Thunder's scoring ability should push this over the total |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 | 1 unit | Value play with implied 23% win probability; Pacers have enough talent to potentially pull an upset if they control tempo and limit Thunder's transition opportunities |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -108 | 2 units | SGA's elite scoring paired with OKC's defensive frontcourt could overwhelm the Pacers; home court advantage amplifies Thunder's ability to go on extended runs |

Each recommendation balances potential return against probability, with stakes reflecting confidence level in each outcome. The spread bets on both sides represent a hedge opportunity if the final margin lands close to the 9.5-point line.
