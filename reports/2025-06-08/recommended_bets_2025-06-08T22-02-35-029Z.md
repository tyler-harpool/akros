## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11.5 | -110 | 3 units | Double-digit NBA spreads are historically difficult to cover consistently. FanDuel offers the valuable half-point hook compared to DraftKings, and Indiana's offensive firepower with Haliburton/Siakam should keep them competitive. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 228.5 | -108 | 2 units | Games with large spreads often feature slower 4th quarters as the leading team manages their advantage. Both teams have elite rim protectors (Holmgren/Turner) who can limit high-percentage interior scoring. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alternate Spread | Pacers +7.5 | +170 | 1 unit | The Pacers have the offensive weapons to potentially keep this game closer than the market expects. This alternate line offers significant value if Indiana can stay within single digits. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +440 | 1 unit | While a longshot, the implied probability (18.5%) undervalues Indiana's upset potential. The Pacers' shooting and playmaking give them paths to victory that justify a small-stake flyer at these odds. |

For optimal value, place the spread and moneyline bets at FanDuel and the under bet at DraftKings based on the current odds differential between sportsbooks.
