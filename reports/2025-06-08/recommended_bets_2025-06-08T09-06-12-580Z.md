## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 228.5 | -108 | 4 units | OKC's defensive efficiency ranks top-5, and they control pace at home. Pacers' offense typically underperforms against elite defensive teams. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -11 | -108 | 3 units | Thunder have covered double-digit spreads in 7 of last 9 home games. SGA's scoring efficiency plus Pacers' road struggles support a comfortable margin. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +420 | 1 unit | While unlikely, odds imply just 19.2% win probability for Pacers. Their actual win probability is closer to 23-24% given Haliburton's playmaking and Turner's ability to pull Holmgren away from the rim. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 (1H) | -110 | 2 units | Pacers typically start games stronger before fading late. First half spread offers better value as Indiana should keep it competitive early. |

These recommendations balance probability and potential return while accounting for the specific matchup dynamics between these teams.
