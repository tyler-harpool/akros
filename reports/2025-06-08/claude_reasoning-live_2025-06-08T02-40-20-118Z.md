Let me analyze the available information for the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game. This appears to be a live in-game betting scenario, so I need to focus on the current game state, momentum, and recent events.

## First, let's summarize what we know:

- Game: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers
- Date: June 9, 2025
- Available Markets: Moneyline, Spread, and Totals

## Betting Lines:
- Moneyline: OKC heavily favored (-520 DraftKings, -560 FanDuel) vs Indiana (+390 DraftKings, +420 FanDuel)
- Spread: OKC -11 points (-108) vs Indiana +11 points (-112) on both DraftKings and FanDuel
- Totals: 228.5 points with Over at -112 and Under at -108 on both books

## What's missing:
- Current game score
- Current game time/quarter
- Recent game flow information
- Player performance data for the current game
- Starting lineups
- Injury information

This creates some significant limitations in my analysis. However, based on the betting lines, I can infer that:

1. Oklahoma City is heavily favored to win the game (implied probability of ~84-85%)
2. OKC is expected to win by around 11 points
3. The game is expected to be relatively high-scoring (228.5 points)
4. The fact that this is a live betting scenario suggests the game is already in progress

Without current game state information, I'm limited in my ability to make highly specific recommendations. However, I can analyze the general betting landscape and make some reasonable inferences.

The fact that OKC is an 11-point favorite suggests they're either:
1. A significantly better team than Indiana in general
2. Playing at home with a meaningful home-court advantage
3. Currently leading by a decent margin in the game
4. Some combination of these factors

The betting edge analysis indicates "No significant edges detected in the current betting markets," suggesting the lines are relatively fair. This means I should be cautious with recommendations.

Since I don't have information about the current game state, I'll need to make more general recommendations based on typical NBA game patterns and the available odds.

For live in-game betting, here are some general strategies that might be applicable:

1. **Momentum swings**: NBA games often feature runs by both teams. If a team goes on a run, there's often value in betting on the other team to bounce back, especially if the spread widens significantly.

2. **Quarter/Half patterns**: Some teams start strong but fade, while others are "second half teams." Without specific team data, I can't apply this precisely.

3. **Star player performance**: If a star player is having an unusually good/bad game, this can significantly impact the outcome.

4. **Foul trouble**: Players in foul trouble can dramatically change a team's effectiveness.

5. **Pace of play**: If the game is being played at a faster/slower pace than expected, this affects the total.

Since I don't have specific information about the current game state, I'll make some general recommendations based on typical NBA betting value spots, acknowledging these limitations:

Recommendations:
1. If OKC is leading by significantly MORE than 11 points, there might be value on Indiana +11, as NBA games often tighten in the 4th quarter due to garbage time.
2. If the pace is slower than expected and the total points scored plus projected remaining points is below 228.5, there might be value on the Under.
3. If Indiana is showing signs of competitiveness despite being a big underdog, their moneyline at +390/+420 might offer value.

However, without current game state information, these recommendations are speculative and should be approached with caution.

Since I'm asked to provide 3-5 specific bet recommendations, I'll frame these as conditional recommendations based on possible game states, but note that this is less than ideal without current game information:

1. Indiana Pacers +11 (-112) - If OKC is leading by more than 15 points, there might be regression to the mean and garbage time scoring that helps Indiana cover.
2. Under 228.5 (-108) - If the current pace suggests a lower-scoring game than the line indicates.
3. Indiana ML (+420) - Only if the game is within 5 points and Indiana is showing strong signs of competitiveness.
4. Quarter-specific bet - Bet on the team that lost the previous quarter to win the next quarter, as NBA games often feature momentum swings.

These recommendations are heavily caveated by the lack of current game information. In a live betting scenario, current game state is absolutely critical for making informed recommendations.

Let me now try to structure these into the required format, recognizing the limitations:
