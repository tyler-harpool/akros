## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -112 | 3 | While Thunder should win, 11 points is a significant cushion for a Pacers team with strong offensive capabilities through Haliburton, Siakam and Turner. Historical data shows Indiana tends to keep games competitive even in losses. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 228.5 | -112 | 4 | Both teams have efficient offensive weapons. Pacers play at a high tempo, which should create additional possessions. If Thunder build a lead, game pace will likely increase as Pacers push to catch up. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -535 | 1 | Though offering minimal return, this represents a high probability outcome for parlay building or conservative bankroll growth. Thunder's superiority at home should translate to a victory. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -11 (1H) | -110* | 2 | Thunder typically start strong at home and could build an early lead before any potential Pacers comeback attempt in the second half. |

*Estimated odds for first half spread based on standard pricing

These recommendations balance probability and value while considering the projected lineup dynamics and historical performance patterns of both franchises.
