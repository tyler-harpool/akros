## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Pacers +11 | -112 | 2 | If OKC is leading by 15+ points, regression to mean and potential garbage time scoring create value on the underdog spread |
| OKC vs IND | Total | Under 228.5 | -108 | 2 | The juice favors the under slightly, and NBA games often slow down in later stages, especially with large leads |
| OKC vs IND | Moneyline | Pacers | +420 | 1 | Small value play if game is within single digits; offers significant return at +420 |
| OKC vs IND | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | +140* | 2 | If game is closer than the spread suggests, this alternate line offers value while still backing the favorite |

*Note: The alternate spread odds are estimated as they weren't provided in the data. Actual odds may vary.

For more precise recommendations, I would need current game state information including score, time remaining, foul situations, and recent momentum indicators.
