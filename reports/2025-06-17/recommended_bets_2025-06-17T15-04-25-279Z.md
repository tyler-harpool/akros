## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -102 (BetMGM) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other books at better odds; critical in games decided by exactly 5 points |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +172 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best underdog value across all books; implied 36.8% win probability may undervalue Pacers |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 224 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Lowest total threshold of all books gives maximum cushion for an over bet |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 225.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Highest total threshold offers maximum cushion for an under bet; can be paired with over 224 for potential middle opportunity |

Note: The over 224/under 225.5 combination creates a potential "middle" opportunity, where both bets could win if the total lands at exactly 225 points, while limiting downside if the total falls outside this range.
