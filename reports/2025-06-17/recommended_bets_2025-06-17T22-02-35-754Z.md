## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Best available price for home underdog with significant cushion; Pacers' home-court advantage and up-tempo style could keep this competitive |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Market is leaning under (reflected in juice); Thunder's defensive discipline likely to contain Pacers' pace; best price available |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -258 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best price for the favored team; Thunder's projected trajectory suggests they should handle road environment |
| Pacers vs Thunder | H2H Value | Pacers | +220 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | Small value play on home underdog at best available price; +220 suggests just 31.3% win probability which may undervalue home court |

These recommendations balance the projected team strengths with the value available in current betting markets, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in projecting a matchup nearly a year in advance.
