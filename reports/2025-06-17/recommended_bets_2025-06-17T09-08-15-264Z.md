## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -4.5 | -110 | 3 | Half-point value at BetMGM compared to -5 elsewhere; key number advantage in what's projected as a moderately close game |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +168 | 1 | Best underdog value at FanDuel; offers potential return of 1.68 units for a 1-unit risk in a game that isn't heavily lopsided |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 225 | -110 | 2 | Taking the highest available total on DraftKings; slight edge over lower totals at other books |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Thunder -1.5 | -155 | 2 | Calculated value based on moneyline-to-spread conversion; essentially buying 3 points from the standard spread for greater security |

*Note: Due to limited team-specific information, these recommendations focus on identifying the best available lines rather than team matchup advantages. Stakes are relatively conservative to reflect the limited available data.*
