## Tuesday, June 17, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +8.5 | +112 (FanDuel) | 3 | Clear value compared to DraftKings pricing. Pacers' high-tempo offense can close gaps quickly in live game situations. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Over 222.5 | -102 (FanDuel) | 3 | Significant price advantage over BetMGM's -125. If Pacers are trailing, they'll likely increase pace and shot volume. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Over 221.5 | -120 (DraftKings) | 2 | Lower total line than competitors with reasonable juice. The extra point of cushion provides added security in this live betting scenario. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -620 (DraftKings) | 1 | Despite low return, offers safer option than FanDuel's -1000 if Thunder maintain control through the final minutes. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so these opportunities may only be available for a short time. The recommendations are based on the current odds and inferred game state at the time of analysis.
