## Tuesday, June 17, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -110 | 3 | Half-point advantage at BetMGM compared to +5 elsewhere; significant value in close game scenarios |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -190 | 2 | Best available Thunder ML odds at BetMGM if you believe the favorite maintains control |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 224 | -110 | 3 | FanDuel's lower total provides better value than 224.5 elsewhere if pace remains up-tempo |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +170 | 1 | DraftKings offers best underdog value if Pacers have momentum or are mounting a comeback |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so these recommendations are time-sensitive. Without specific game state information like current score, time remaining, and momentum indicators, these selections focus on identifying the best available odds across bookmakers for the most likely game outcomes.
