## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 | Thunder's superior offensive efficiency is creating separation; FanDuel offers the best value on this line compared to other books |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Celtics +2.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 4 | Extra half-point provides crucial cushion in this tight matchup; Celtics' perimeter defense keeping them competitive throughout |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Over 216.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | Pace and shooting percentages trending upward; both teams finding offensive rhythm in transition opportunities |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Moneyline | Celtics | +115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Best underdog value as Celtics have shown resilience on the road; BetMGM offers superior odds compared to other sportsbooks |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +165 (BetMGM) | 1 | Low-risk, high-reward opportunity if Denver's home court advantage sparks a momentum shift; valuable hedge against spread bet |

I've focused on identifying the best available odds across bookmakers while considering the current game dynamics. The stakes reflect confidence levels based on perceived value and risk assessment.
