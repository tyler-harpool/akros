Alright, let's analyze the two NBA games provided and develop strategic betting recommendations. 

# Game 1: Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/16/2025)

First, let's analyze the key information about this matchup:

## Betting Lines Summary
- Moneyline: Denver is favored (-198 to -200) against OKC (+164 to +168)
- Spread: Denver is favored by 5 to 5.5 points
- Totals: 215.5-216.5 range

## Team Lineups
- Denver has their core starting lineup intact (Murray, Braun, Porter, Gordon, Jokic)
- OKC has their key players (SGA, Dort, Williams, Holmgren, Hartenstein)

## Analysis
1. The Nuggets are established as clear favorites, indicated by both moneyline and spread.
2. The total points line is around 216, suggesting bookmakers expect a moderate scoring game.
3. Denver has home court advantage, which is significant in the NBA.
4. Lineups show both teams have their key players available, so no major advantage due to injuries.

Denver's offense runs through Nikola Jokic, who creates mismatches against most opponents. In this matchup, OKC has Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein who might take turns defending Jokic, but they'll likely struggle against his skill set. Jamal Murray's scoring capability is another factor that gives Denver an edge.

The Thunder have a dynamic star in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who can score at will, but Denver has playoff experience and the championship pedigree from their recent title run.

# Game 2: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (5/17/2025)

## Betting Lines Summary
- Moneyline: New York is favored (-135 to -146) against Boston (+114 to +124)
- Spread: New York is favored by 2.5 points
- Totals: 209.5-210.5 range

## Team Lineups
- No lineup data available for either team

## Analysis
1. The Knicks are moderate favorites at home, with a tight 2.5-point spread.
2. The total points line around 210 suggests bookmakers expect a lower-scoring game.
3. Without lineup information, we'd need to monitor news about potential injuries or rest decisions.

This matchup features two Eastern Conference teams with traditionally strong defenses. The Celtics typically have more offensive firepower with their star wings, but the Knicks being favored suggests either home court advantage is being heavily weighted or there might be some key Boston players potentially out or limited.

Since we don't have lineup information for this game, making a confident bet would require checking injury reports closer to game time.

# Identifying Betting Values

For Denver vs OKC:
1. The spread at 5-5.5 points seems reasonable given Denver's home court and slight talent advantage.
2. The total at 215.5-216.5 seems appropriate for these teams' pace and defensive capabilities.
3. I see potential value in player props (though not provided in the data) focusing on Jokic's production.

For NY vs Boston:
1. The tight spread of 2.5 points suggests a competitive game.
2. Without lineup information, it's difficult to assess true value.
3. The moneyline odds for Boston (+114 to +124) could be valuable if they have their full roster.

# Recommended Bets Analysis

Based on the available information, here are the bets that appear to have the most value:

1. Denver Nuggets -5 (-112) at DraftKings: Denver has their full lineup and home court advantage. Their playoff experience and Jokic's dominance give them an edge that could lead to a margin greater than 5 points.

2. Over 215.5 (-115) in the Denver-OKC game at BetMGM: Both teams have efficient offenses capable of scoring. Denver's home court tends to see higher-scoring games due to the altitude factor, which can lead to faster pace and more transition opportunities.

3. Boston Celtics +2.5 (-110) at DraftKings/FanDuel: Boston is typically undervalued as an underdog. Without knowing lineup details, their overall team quality suggests they can keep this game close or win outright against the Knicks.

4. Under 210.5 (-115) in the NY-Boston game at BetMGM: Both are defensive-minded teams, especially in playoffs/important games. The pressure of the game could lead to a lower-scoring affair.

Now I'll formalize these into the recommended bets format:
