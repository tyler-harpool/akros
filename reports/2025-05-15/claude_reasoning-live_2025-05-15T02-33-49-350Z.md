Let me analyze the provided betting information, focusing on the live in-game situation between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Golden State Warriors, as well as the upcoming games.

## Key Observations:

### Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors (IN PROGRESS)
- This game is currently in progress
- The Warriors are heavy favorites with moneyline odds ranging from -460 to -525
- The spread is around -8.5 to -9.5 in favor of the Warriors
- The total points line is between 209.5 and 211.5

This indicates that the Warriors have a substantial lead or momentum in the game. The fact that they're -8.5 to -9.5 favorites in a game that's in progress suggests they're likely ahead by approximately that margin or perhaps slightly more.

For the total, the range of 209.5 to 211.5 is moderate for an NBA game, suggesting a somewhat average pace or that a significant portion of the game has already been played, reducing the expected remaining points.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (Upcoming)
- Oklahoma City is favored on the road with moneyline odds of -186 to -205
- The spread is between -4.5 and -5.5 in favor of OKC
- The total points consensus is 216.5 across all bookmakers

This indicates that Oklahoma City is considered the superior team despite playing in Denver, which usually provides a home-court advantage due to altitude.

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (Upcoming)
- Boston is slightly favored on the road with moneyline odds ranging from -126 to -140
- The spread is tight, between -1.5 and -2.5 in favor of Boston
- The total points range from 209 to 210.5

This suggests a very competitive matchup with Boston having a slight edge playing in New York.

## Live Betting Analysis (Timberwolves vs Warriors):

Without specific information about the current score, time remaining, and recent game flow, I'll have to make some reasonable assumptions:

1. The Warriors appear to be in control with a lead of approximately 8-10 points
2. The odds suggest the market believes the Warriors will maintain or extend this lead
3. The total suggests we're likely in the middle of the game (not early or very late)

In live betting, I need to consider:
- Current momentum
- Foul trouble for key players
- Shooting performance vs. expected performance
- Pace of play relative to expectations
- How the market may be overreacting to recent events

For the Warriors-Timberwolves game, if the Warriors are ahead by around 8-10 points, a spread of -8.5 to -9.5 means the market expects them to maintain this lead. This could present value on the Timberwolves if:
1. They've been shooting unusually poorly and might regress to the mean
2. The Warriors have been shooting unusually well and might cool off
3. Key Warriors players are in foul trouble
4. The Timberwolves have shown an ability to make comebacks this season

For the total, the current line of 209.5-211.5 could present value if:
1. The pace has been slower or faster than anticipated
2. Teams are shooting significantly above or below their season averages
3. There's been a change in defensive intensity

For the upcoming games, I'll focus on finding value based on current form, matchups, and market inefficiencies.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder:

The Thunder being favored on the road in Denver is significant. Denver typically has a strong home-court advantage due to the altitude. For OKC to be favored by 4.5-5.5 points suggests they're perceived as the clearly superior team right now.

The total of 216.5 across all bookmakers indicates a consensus on the expected scoring. This could present value if there are specific matchup factors that might lead to a higher or lower scoring game than the market expects.

## New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics:

This is projected to be a close game, with Boston slightly favored on the road. The tight spread of -1.5 to -2.5 reflects this. The total of 209-210.5 is relatively low for an NBA game, suggesting expectations of defensive play or slower pace.

## Recommended Bets Analysis:

For the live game (Warriors vs Timberwolves):
Without knowing the exact game state, it's difficult to make specific recommendations. However, based on the provided odds, here are potential value opportunities:

1. If the Warriors are ahead by significantly more than 9.5 points, taking the Timberwolves +9.5 at -125 (BetMGM) could have value if Minnesota shows signs of a potential comeback.

2. If the current pace is notably faster or slower than expected, there could be value in the total points market.

For the upcoming games:

1. Denver Nuggets +5 (-110) at DraftKings: Denver's home-court advantage is significant, and getting 5 points at home could present value, especially if the Nuggets have performed well recently.

2. Knicks vs Celtics Under 210.5 (-115) at BetMGM: If these teams have been playing strong defense recently, the under could have value.

Since I don't have specific information about current team form, recent performance, or player injuries, these recommendations are based on the odds and general NBA knowledge rather than specific situational factors.

Now, let me prepare the recommended bets section following the required format. I'll be selective since this is a live betting scenario.

Without more specific information about the current game state for the Warriors-Timberwolves game, I'll focus my recommendations primarily on the upcoming games where we have complete information, while still including one live betting opportunity based on the apparent game state.

Here are my recommended bets:

1. Timberwolves +9.5 (-125) at BetMGM (Live betting opportunity)
2. Nuggets +5 (-110) at DraftKings
3. Knicks +2.5 (-115) at BetMGM
4. Knicks vs Celtics Under 210.5 (-115) at BetMGM

I'll format these according to the requirements in my final answer.
