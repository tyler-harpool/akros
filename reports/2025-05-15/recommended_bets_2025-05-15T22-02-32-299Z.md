## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder @ Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +5.5 | -110 | 3 | OKC's young talent keeps games competitive, and they match up relatively well with Denver's frontcourt. This line appears slightly inflated due to Denver's reputation and home court. |
| Thunder @ Nuggets | Total | Over 215.5 | -115 | 2 | Denver's altitude typically accelerates pace, and both teams have efficient offenses. With all key scorers available and neither team playing on a back-to-back, scoring should flow. |
| Celtics @ Knicks | Moneyline | Celtics | +124 | 2 | Boston's overall roster quality provides value at plus money. The Celtics have performed well as underdogs this season and have the star power to overcome the Knicks' home court advantage. |
| Celtics @ Knicks | Total | Under 210.5 | -115 | 3 | Both teams emphasize defensive intensity, especially in high-stakes games. The Knicks consistently try to slow pace at home, and Boston's defensive versatility should limit easy scoring opportunities. |

These recommendations balance probability and value, focusing on spots where the market appears slightly inefficient based on team matchups and situational factors.
