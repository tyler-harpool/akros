## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors @ Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +10.5 | -110 | 2 | Double-digit spreads often provide value in the NBA. While Minnesota is rightfully favored, Golden State's offensive firepower and experience make them capable of keeping this closer than the market expects. |
| Thunder @ Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +4.5 | -108 | 3 | Denver historically performs well at home, making this 4.5-point home underdog line attractive. The Nuggets' playoff experience and home-court advantage should allow them to keep this competitive throughout. |
| Thunder @ Nuggets | Total | Over 216.5 | -110 | 2 | Both teams possess excellent offensive weapons that can exploit defensive weaknesses. Denver plays at a faster pace at home, and playoff intensity should produce sufficient scoring to exceed this moderate total. |
| Celtics @ Knicks | Moneyline | Knicks | +124 | 1 | While this is an IN-GAME recommendation with limited context, FanDuel's more generous odds compared to other bookmakers (+124 vs +100/+105) offer value if the game remains competitive in the late stages. |

Remember that live betting recommendations contain additional uncertainty, so appropriate bankroll management is crucial. For the Knicks moneyline bet in particular, consider your own assessment of the current game situation before placing this wager.
