Let me analyze the information provided for NBA betting opportunities on May 15, 2025.

First, I'll note that one game is currently in progress (Celtics vs. Knicks), while the other two games (Timberwolves vs. Warriors and Nuggets vs. Thunder) are upcoming. Let me break down each game:

## 1. Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks (IN PROGRESS)

Since this game is in progress, I need to be cautious with my analysis as I don't have information about the current score, time remaining, or other in-game factors that would heavily influence live betting decisions.

Looking at the moneyline odds:
- Celtics are favored across all bookmakers (-130 to -158)
- Knicks are underdogs (100 to 124)

Spread odds vary significantly:
- DraftKings: Celtics -2.5
- FanDuel: Celtics -3.5
- BetMGM: Celtics -1.5

This variation in the spread suggests there may be some uncertainty about the current game state and how it might progress.

For totals, the line is between 221.5 and 222.5 points.

Without knowing the current game state (score, quarter, time remaining, foul situation, etc.), it's difficult to make confident live betting recommendations. The discrepancy in spread lines across bookmakers might indicate an opportunity, but I'd need more information about the game context.

## 2. Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

This game hasn't started yet. The odds show:

Moneyline:
- Timberwolves are heavy favorites (-480 to -500)
- Warriors are substantial underdogs (370 to 375)

Spread:
- Consistently -10.5 points for Timberwolves across all bookmakers
- BetMGM offers slightly better value for Timberwolves at -105

Totals:
- Line is between 202.5 and 203 points
- FanDuel has a slightly higher total at 203 with -114 for over

The betting market clearly sees Minnesota as strong favorites at home. The 10.5-point spread is substantial and indicates bookmakers expect a comfortable Timberwolves win. The relatively low total (202.5-203) suggests an expected slower-paced or defensive-oriented game.

## 3. Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

This game is scheduled for May 16. The odds show:

Moneyline:
- Thunder are favorites (-190 to -200)
- Nuggets are underdogs (160 to 165)

Spread:
- Thunder -4.5 consistently across all bookmakers
- Odds are fairly consistent across bookmakers

Totals:
- Consistent 216.5 points across all bookmakers
- Odds are balanced at -110 each way

Interestingly, Oklahoma City is favored despite Denver typically being a strong home team. This suggests potential injury concerns for Denver or other factors making OKC the perceived better team at this moment.

Now, let me think about potential betting recommendations:

For the Celtics vs. Knicks game, without current game state information, I'm limited in what I can confidently recommend for live betting.

For Timberwolves vs. Warriors:
- The spread of -10.5 is large, even for a home favorite. If the Warriors are at full strength (which I can't confirm without lineup information), they might be worth considering as 10.5-point underdogs, particularly with the slightly better odds on BetMGM (-115).
- The total of 202.5/203 appears low for modern NBA, especially if both teams are at full strength offensively. However, Minnesota is known for strong defense, which could justify the lower total.

For Nuggets vs. Thunder:
- The Thunder being favored by 4.5 on the road in Denver is noteworthy. Without injury information, this suggests bookmakers see OKC as the significantly better team right now.
- The total of 216.5 seems reasonable for these teams.

Based on the limited information available, here are some potential recommendations:

1. Warriors +10.5 (-115) at BetMGM - The spread is large, and if the Warriors are at full strength, they could keep it competitive.

2. Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203 (-114) at FanDuel - This total seems low for modern NBA, especially if both teams are healthy.

3. Nuggets +4.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - Denver typically plays well at home, and getting 4.5 points could offer value, especially if they're at full strength.

4. Celtics-Knicks Under 222.5 (-118) at BetMGM - Without knowing the game state, this is speculative, but if the game has been defensive so far, the under could have value.

However, I should be cautious with these recommendations given the limitations on injury and lineup information. For the live Celtics-Knicks game, especially, the lack of current game state makes any recommendation highly speculative.

Let me review the available information one more time and finalize my recommendations:

For Celtics vs. Knicks, there's a discrepancy in the spread across bookmakers, with BetMGM offering Celtics -1.5 while FanDuel has Celtics -3.5. This 2-point difference is significant and suggests an opportunity to take Celtics -1.5 (-115) at BetMGM if you believe the Celtics have an edge.

For Timberwolves vs. Warriors, BetMGM offers Warriors +10.5 at -115, which is slightly worse than DraftKings at -110, so I'll adjust my recommendation to DraftKings.

For Nuggets vs. Thunder, FanDuel offers the best value on Nuggets +4.5 at -108.

Here are my final recommendations:

1. Celtics -1.5 (-115) at BetMGM - Taking advantage of the line discrepancy across bookmakers.

2. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - The spread is large for what could be a competitive game.

3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - Denver typically plays well at home, and this spread seems generous.

4. Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203 (-114) at FanDuel - This total seems low for modern NBA basketball.

For stake sizes, I'll assign 1-5 units based on confidence level, with higher units indicating greater confidence:

1. Celtics -1.5 (-115) - 3 units (medium-high confidence due to line discrepancy)
2. Warriors +10.5 (-110) - 2 units (medium confidence)
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) - 3 units (medium-high confidence due to home court)
4. Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203 (-114) - 2 units (medium confidence)

Now let me format these recommendations into the required table format.

Actually, let me reconsider my recommendations one last time:

1. The Celtics-Knicks recommendation is problematic without knowing the current game state. The spread discrepancy is interesting, but without context of the score, time remaining, and momentum, it's hard to make a confident recommendation.

2. For the Warriors +10.5, I need to consider that the Timberwolves are heavily favored (-485 to -500), which suggests strong confidence in Minnesota. Without knowing if key Warriors players might be injured or resting, taking the Warriors with the points has uncertain value.

3. The Nuggets +4.5 seems potentially strong, but again, without injury information, I need to consider why OKC is favored by this margin on the road.

4. For the Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203, Minnesota's strong defense could keep the total low, especially if Warriors are missing key offensive players.

Given the lack of lineup information and current game state for the live game, I should be more conservative with my recommendations.

Let me revise and provide more cautious recommendations with appropriate stake sizes:

1. Celtics-Knicks Under 221.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 1 unit (low confidence due to live game with unknown state)
2. Warriors +10.5 (-105) at BetMGM - 2 units (choosing the best odds available)
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units (home underdog value)
4. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - 2 units (these teams have offensive firepower)

Let me check the odds once more before finalizing:

For the Warriors +10.5, BetMGM offers -115 while DraftKings and FanDuel offer -110 and -112 respectively. So DraftKings has the best value at -110.

For Nuggets +4.5, FanDuel offers -108 while the others offer -110, so FanDuel provides the best value.

Let me finalize my recommendations with appropriate caution and confidence levels:

1. Celtics-Knicks Under 221.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 1 unit (low confidence due to live game with unknown state)
2. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units (significant spread, but limited lineup information)
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units (home court advantage, good odds)
4. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - 2 units (teams with offensive capability)

I don't have information for the first bet on Celtics-Knicks, as I don't know the current score or time remaining. For the others, I lack lineup and injury information to make truly confident recommendations. So it's important to emphasize that these recommendations come with significant uncertainty.

Actually, let me make one more revision: I notice that taking BetMGM odds for Warriors +10.5 would be -115, which is worse than DraftKings at -110. So I'll stick with DraftKings for that bet.

For the Celtics-Knicks bet, given that it's a live bet with unknown game state, I shouldn't confidently recommend a side or total. So I'll remove that recommendation.

Final recommendations:
1. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units
2. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units
3. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - 2 units

Let me check one more time for the best value on Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5...
All three bookmakers offer the same -110 odds, so it doesn't matter which one is chosen.

1. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units
2. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units
3. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at DraftKings/BetMGM/FanDuel - 2 units

Wait, let me check a final time:
For the Celtics-Knicks game, I actually do have odds data, but I don't have the current score, time remaining, or other live game context. Without that information, making a specific live betting recommendation is difficult.

However, I notice that there's a significant discrepancy in the spread across bookmakers:
- BetMGM: Celtics -1.5 (-115)
- DraftKings: Celtics -2.5 (-110)
- FanDuel: Celtics -3.5 (108)

This suggests that taking the Celtics -1.5 (-115) at BetMGM might offer value compared to the other bookmakers' lines. While I don't know the exact game state, the fact that there's a 2-point difference between BetMGM and FanDuel's spread suggests potential value. I'll include this as a cautious recommendation with a lower stake (1 unit).

Let me finalize my recommendations:

1. Celtics -1.5 (-115) at BetMGM - 1 unit (low confidence live bet, based on line discrepancy)
2. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units (large spread, moderate value)
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units (home court advantage, good odds)
4. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - 2 units (teams with offensive capability)

I'll now present these in the required table format.

Actually, because the spread in Celtics-Knicks game is so different between bookmakers (BetMGM at -1.5 and FanDuel at -3.5), it's likely that I'm looking at odds that were captured at different points during the live game. Without knowing which one reflects the current state more accurately, it's risky to make a recommendation based on this discrepancy.

Since I have incomplete information on the live game, I'll remove the Celtics-Knicks recommendation. This leaves me with 3 recommendations, which still falls within the required 3-5 range:

1. Warriors +10.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units
2. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units
3. Thunder-Nuggets Over 216.5 (-110) at any bookmaker - 2 units
