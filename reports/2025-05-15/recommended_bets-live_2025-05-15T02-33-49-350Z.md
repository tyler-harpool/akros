## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Timberwolves +9.5 | -140 (FanDuel) | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Minnesota has historically shown resilience in playoff scenarios. If Warriors' shooting regresses to the mean, this cushion provides value given the game context. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 | Denver's home-court advantage at altitude is significant and often undervalued. Getting 5 points at home for a team with championship experience represents value. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | 170 (DraftKings) | 1 | The implied 37% win probability for Denver at home seems low given their playoff experience and historical performance at altitude. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total | Under 210.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Both teams have strong defensive identities and playoff matchups typically feature tighter defense and more halfcourt sets, leading to lower scoring. |

Note that the live bet recommendation is particularly time-sensitive and should only be placed if the current game state and momentum align with the analysis provided.
