## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs. Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +4.5 | -105 | 3 units | OKC has been strong at home, and while Denver has championship experience, the Thunder's athletic, up-tempo style should keep this game within two possessions. Best value at DraftKings/BetMGM. |
| Thunder vs. Nuggets | Total | Under 216 | -108 | 2 units | Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and more deliberate offensive possessions. Both teams have capable defenders who can slow the pace in a high-stakes matchup. |
| Knicks vs. Celtics | Spread | Knicks -2 | -110 | 2 units | FanDuel offers the best line with only 2 points (vs. 2.5 elsewhere). The Knicks' home court advantage should be worth more than 2 points in a playoff environment. |
| Knicks vs. Celtics | Total | Under 210.5 | -115 | 3 units | This matchup historically produces defensive slugfests in playoff settings. BetMGM offers the highest total number, providing the best value for an under bet. |
| Thunder vs. Nuggets | Moneyline | Nuggets | -185 | 1 unit | Despite the juice, Denver's championship pedigree makes them likely winners. Their core has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to execute in playoff road games. DraftKings offers the best value. |

These selections balance potential return with reasonable probability based on the matchup dynamics and current market offerings.
