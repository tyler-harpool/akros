## Evaluating Betting Opportunities

Since no statistical edges were explicitly identified in the analysis provided, I'll need to look for potential value based on the odds and lineups provided.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

1. **Game Context Considerations**:
   - This appears to be a playoff matchup between two strong Western Conference teams
   - Denver has championship experience with their core, which provides value in playoff settings
   - OKC is the younger, more athletic team playing at home

2. **Betting Value**:
   - The spread of 4.5-5 points seems reasonable given Denver's experience edge but OKC's home court advantage
   - The total of 215.5-216 seems appropriate for these teams that can both score efficiently
   
3. **Potential Edges**:
   - FanDuel's spread of Denver -5 (-108) could offer value if you believe Denver's experience will lead to a comfortable win
   - DraftKings/BetMGM's OKC +4.5 (-105) could be valuable if you think OKC's home court and athleticism will keep this close
   - For totals, I'm inclined toward the under given playoff basketball tends to be more defensive and deliberate

### New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics

1. **Game Context Considerations**:
   - This appears to be an Eastern Conference playoff matchup
   - Without lineup information, it's difficult to assess injury impacts
   - Both teams are strong Eastern Conference contenders

2. **Betting Value**:
   - The 2-2.5 point spread favoring the home Knicks suggests oddsmakers see this as a close matchup
   - The total around 209-210.5 is relatively low, indicating expectations of a defensive battle

3. **Potential Edges**:
   - FanDuel's Knicks -2 (-110) offers better value than the -2.5 at other books if you like New York
   - DraftKings' Celtics +2.5 (-110) offers the best value if you like Boston to keep it close
   - For totals, BetMGM's Under 210.5 (-115) gives you the highest total number to work with

## Developing Bet Recommendations

Based on my analysis, here are potential recommendations:

1. **Oklahoma City Thunder +4.5 (-105) on DraftKings/BetMGM**
   - Reasoning: The Thunder are a talented young team playing at home. While Denver has experience, the 4.5 point spread provides good value for a home playoff team with the talent of OKC.

2. **Denver/OKC Under 216 (-108) on DraftKings**
   - Reasoning: Playoff basketball tends to be more defensive and methodical. While both teams can score, the intensity of playoff defense could keep this game under the total.

3. **New York Knicks -2 (-110) on FanDuel**
   - Reasoning: The Knicks as home favorites by only 2 points is attractive, especially compared to -2.5 at other books. Home court advantage in playoff games is significant.

4. **Celtics/Knicks Under 210.5 (-115) on BetMGM**
   - Reasoning: This gives us the highest total number among the books, and playoff basketball between these two defensive-minded teams could trend under.

5. **Denver Nuggets Moneyline (-185) on DraftKings**
   - Reasoning: While not the best value bet, Denver's championship pedigree and core makes them likely winners. The -185 at DraftKings offers the best value among the moneyline options for Denver.

Now I'll assign stakes based on confidence level (1-5 units):

1. **Oklahoma City Thunder +4.5 (-105)** - 3 units (medium-high confidence)
2. **Denver/OKC Under 216 (-108)** - 2 units (medium confidence)
3. **New York Knicks -2 (-110)** - 2 units (medium confidence)
4. **Celtics/Knicks Under 210.5 (-115)** - 3 units (medium-high confidence)
5. **Denver Nuggets Moneyline (-185)** - 1 unit (lower confidence due to odds value)

I'll recommend these five bets in my final response, focusing on the ones with the best value and highest confidence.
