## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs. Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -110 | 3 | Denver's home court advantage at altitude combined with their championship experience gives them an edge to cover this moderate spread. Jokic creates matchup problems that OKC will struggle to contain. |
| Nuggets vs. Thunder | Total | Under 217.5 | -112 | 2 | While both teams have offensive weapons, playoff basketball typically features increased defensive intensity and more deliberate possessions. The altitude factor may also impact scoring efficiency as the game progresses. |
| Nuggets vs. Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder +160 | 160 | 1 | Small value play on the Thunder at plus money. Their athleticism and SGA's scoring ability give them upset potential if Denver's shooting goes cold. |
| Knicks vs. Celtics | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -105 | 2 | The Knicks' home court advantage at MSG provides enough edge to cover this small spread. BetMGM offers the best value at -105. |
| Knicks vs. Celtics | Total | Under 209.5 | -110 | 2 | With playoff intensity likely in effect, expect a defensively focused game with deliberate possessions and high-pressure situations limiting scoring opportunities. |

Note that the bets on the Knicks-Celtics game carry more uncertainty due to the lack of lineup information. Consider waiting for injury reports before finalizing these wagers.
