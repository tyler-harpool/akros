## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | Significant value discrepancy between bookmakers (-190 vs -218). Denver's home court advantage and historical success against Minnesota make this price attractive. |
| Golden State Warriors vs San Antonio Spurs (11/15/25) | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 | 3 units | Market inconsistency with even moneyline but Warriors favored on spread. Golden State's veteran experience should prevail in close games. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 | 3 units | Thunder's projected elite status vs developing Spurs team. Christmas Day spotlight tends to magnify talent advantages for contending teams. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 2 units | Home court value in a tight matchup. DraftKings offers better value than FanDuel (-122), and Lakers traditionally perform well in spotlight games. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (12/25/25) | Totals | Under 226.5 | -110 | 2 units | Christmas Day games historically trend toward more defensive play. FanDuel's higher total (226.5 vs 225.5) creates value on the under. |

These recommendations are based on identifying market inefficiencies through line discrepancies and projected team performance considerations. Without specific lineup information, the analysis focuses on structural advantages and pricing inconsistencies in the betting markets.
