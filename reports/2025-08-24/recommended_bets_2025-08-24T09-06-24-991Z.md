## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 | Significant value compared to DraftKings' -218 line for the same bet. Denver should have home court advantage against division rival. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 2 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings spread. Christmas Day games tend to be more competitive with heightened national exposure. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 | Critical half-point advantage over FanDuel's -1.5 line in what projects to be a close game. Lakers at home with national TV spotlight. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -102 | 2 | Excellent price (-102) on a minimal spread in a game with even moneyline odds. Mavericks should have stronger roster construction. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 | 2 | Value opportunity in a pick'em type matchup where Warriors have slight home court advantage but are priced as slight underdogs. |

These recommendations focus on instances where line shopping reveals clear value and where small spread advantages could make significant differences in the outcomes of your bets.
