## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Moneyline | Spurs | -110 | 3 units | The Spurs have established better offensive rhythm in the second quarter. In a game with a pre-game 1-point spread, the market is offering value on the Spurs after Mavs' early run has subsided. |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings | Moneyline | Kings | -102 | 3 units | Kings showing strong defensive adjustments after initial Suns scoring burst. At nearly even money, Sacramento presents value as they've stabilized after weathering Phoenix's home court advantage. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 | 2 units | Warriors' home court advantage is starting to assert itself after a back-and-forth first quarter. The tight spread offers value as Golden State's shooting is trending upward. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers | Moneyline | 76ers | +110 | 2 units | 76ers have weathered Boston's initial run and are showing better half-court execution. The underdog price offers significant value in what's effectively a pick'em game. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers | Total | Over 219.5 | -110 | 2 units | Both LA teams are pushing pace after a tactical first quarter. The derby atmosphere is creating transition opportunities, and the total appears too low given the current game flow. |
