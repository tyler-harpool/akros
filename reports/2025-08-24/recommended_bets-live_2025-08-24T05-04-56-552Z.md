## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Spread | Spurs +1 | -102 | 3 units | Moneyline shows an even matchup (-110 both ways) but spread favors Mavs. Live in-game trends typically favor the team getting points in virtually even contests. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 units | FanDuel offers significant value compared to DraftKings (-218). Nuggets historically perform well against Wolves, and this 28-point pricing difference represents a market inefficiency. |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings | Spread | Kings +1 | -110 | 2 units | Very tight spread with Kings getting a point despite close moneyline prices. Sacramento typically plays Phoenix competitively, making the point of value. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 2 units | FanDuel's spread is a full half-point more favorable than DraftKings' 10-point spread, creating arbitrage opportunity. Spurs tend to play better against young teams. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets | Moneyline | Rockets | +104 | 2 units | FanDuel offers better value than DraftKings' -102, and young Rockets team matches up well against Lakers' veteran lineup. Potential live underdog opportunity. |

Remember that in-game betting requires quick decisions as lines move rapidly. These recommendations focus on value based on the current market positions, but always consider the game context and momentum before placing your bets.
