## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Significant price difference compared to DraftKings (-218) for the same bet suggests value. Denver should have the edge at home against Minnesota. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +10 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Christmas Day games often feature more competitive performances from underdogs. The half-point difference between bookmakers (9.5 vs 10) creates potential value. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Warriors getting a point at home suggests market uncertainty about these teams. Golden State traditionally plays well in home spotlight games. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers +1 | -118 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Lakers as home underdogs in a city rivalry game presents value, especially with the even moneyline suggesting market uncertainty. |
| Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic (11/26/2025) | Spread | 76ers +1 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | 76ers as home underdogs represents potential value, particularly with the tight moneyline odds suggesting this matchup is essentially a coin flip. |

These recommendations are based primarily on line analysis and market inefficiencies, as no lineup or injury information is currently available. I've assigned moderate stakes (2-3 units) given the limited contextual information at this stage of the season.
