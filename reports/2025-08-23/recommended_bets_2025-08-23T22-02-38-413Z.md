## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| San Antonio Spurs @ Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/2025) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 4 units | By Christmas 2025, Wembanyama should be entering his prime while the Spurs' supporting cast continues developing. The 9.5-point cushion provides significant value against an OKC team that may struggle to consistently win by double digits against improved competition. |
| Philadelphia 76ers @ Orlando Magic (11/26/2025) | Spread | 76ers +1 | -110 | 3 units | Orlando being favored over Philadelphia reflects a significant projected shift in team quality. If the 76ers maintain a competitive core around Embiid, getting a point with the historically stronger franchise represents excellent value, even on the road. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves @ Denver Nuggets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves +5 | -108 | 3 units | Line discrepancy between bookmakers (DK at -5, FD at -4.5) suggests uncertainty. Minnesota's core of Edwards, Towns and Gobert should be in their collective prime by 2025, making this spread too generous for a team that historically plays Denver tough. |
| Houston Rockets @ Oklahoma City Thunder (10/21/2025) | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 2 units | Houston's young core (Green, Sengun, Smith Jr.) should be entering their prime years by 2025, making them more competitive than this spread suggests. OKC is deservedly favored, but Houston's offensive firepower should keep them within the number. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 2 units | The Lakers at home during Christmas week should command a stronger price than -118. The minimal juice required offers value on a franchise that typically performs well in marquee games, regardless of roster construction at that point. |

These recommendations balance current team trajectories with projected development, focusing on spreads that appear too generous given the expected competitive landscape of the 2025-26 NBA season. As we approach these games, updating the analysis with roster information and injury reports will be crucial to confirming these edges.
