## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/25) | Spread | Celtics -2 | -110 | 4 units | Boston only laying 2 points at home is significantly below standard home court advantage. As defending champions with elite talent, they deserve to be favored by at least 4-5 points against Philadelphia at TD Garden. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Mavericks | -110 | 3 units | Even money for Dallas at home indicates the market views Spurs as the slightly better team. Luka's Mavs should command more respect at home, making this a value opportunity against a young Spurs squad. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24/25) | Spread | Warriors -1 | -105 | 3 units | Warriors are only laying 1 point at Chase Center against the Nuggets, well below typical home advantage. Golden State's home court has historically been one of the strongest in the NBA, making this spread too small. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 2 units | Lakers are barely favored at home (-1 spread) against Houston, suggesting the market views these teams as near equals. Los Angeles should command a stronger home court advantage in this high-profile post-Christmas matchup. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 5 units | Significant odds discrepancy between DraftKings (-218) and FanDuel (-190) for the same bet. The FanDuel price offers substantial value for the Nuggets at home against a division rival, presenting both a value play and potential arbitrage opportunity. |

This analysis leverages perceived market inefficiencies while accounting for home court advantage, matchup dynamics, and odds discrepancies between bookmakers. I've allocated stakes based on confidence level and relative value in each opportunity.
