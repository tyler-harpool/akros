## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/2025) | Spread | Celtics -2 | -110 | 3 | Celtics have historically performed well against the 76ers at home. The small 2-point spread represents value considering Boston's projected roster strength and home court advantage. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/25/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers +2.5 | -110 | 3 | Christmas Day games tend to be more competitive and tightly contested. The Cavaliers' getting 2.5 points offers value in what should be a showcase game where underdogs often perform better than expected. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Spread | Warriors -4.5 | -112 | 2 | Warriors have consistently performed well in high-profile home games. Their offensive firepower should allow them to pull away from Dallas, making the 4.5 point spread attainable. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24/2025) | Total | Over 234.5 | -110 | 2 | Both teams feature high-powered offenses with questionable defensive personnel. Their historical matchups regularly produce high scoring totals, making this over attractive. |
| Detroit Pistons vs Boston Celtics (11/26/2025) | Spread | Celtics +1 | -110 | 3 | Market appears to have mispriced this matchup. Boston projects as the stronger team yet is getting points as the underdog, representing significant value. |
