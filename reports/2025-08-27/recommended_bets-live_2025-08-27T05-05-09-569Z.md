## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers | Live Moneyline | Celtics | -130 | 4 | Championship-caliber team with elite execution in close games; if they trail early, look for improved odds as they typically make strong mid-game adjustments |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors | Live Game Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 3 | If first quarter features hot shooting (30+ points each team), the adjusted live total will likely rise; defensive adjustments and shooting regression typically follow |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets | Live Team Total | Thunder Over | -110 | 3 | Elite offensive team that can explode for runs; if they start cold and their team total drops, there's significant value as they rarely stay cold for extended periods |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Live Quarter Spread | Mavericks 4Q | -110 | 2 | Experience edge becomes magnified in close late-game situations; Mavs' veteran closing lineup typically outperforms in final frame |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings | Live Spread | Team trailing at half | -110 | 2 | Extremely tight pre-game spread (-1) indicates even matchup where early leads often evaporate; significant value emerges on whichever team faces a 6+ point deficit |

Remember that timing is critical in live betting - look for these opportunities when momentum shifts or after significant game events create temporary market inefficiencies.
