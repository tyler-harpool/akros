Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the two NBA games on Thursday, May 22, 2025:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves

### Game Context:
This appears to be an NBA playoff game between the Thunder and Timberwolves. The Thunder are heavy favorites at home with moneyline odds around -290 to -295, while the spread is set at -7.5 points. The total is set at around 216.5-217.5 points.

### Team Lineup Analysis:
- **Timberwolves**: They have their core lineup with Anthony Edwards, Mike Conley, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle, and Rudy Gobert. This is a strong defensive team with Gobert anchoring the defense. Julius Randle is listed here, which is interesting as he was traded from the Knicks to the Timberwolves (based on the projected lineup).
- **Thunder**: They have Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (an MVP-caliber player), Luguentz Dort (defensive specialist), Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and Isaiah Hartenstein. They also list N. Topic (likely Nikola Topic) as a bench player.

### Statistical Considerations:
- The Thunder are significant favorites at home, suggesting they might be the higher seed or have home-court advantage in this playoff series.
- The total of 216.5-217.5 suggests a moderate-scoring game, which aligns with these teams' defensive capabilities.
- The 7.5-point spread is substantial for a playoff game, indicating oddsmakers see a significant gap between these teams.

### Betting Opportunities:
1. **Spread**: The 7.5-point spread is substantial for a playoff game. Minnesota has strong defenders in Gobert and McDaniels who might keep the game closer than expected. Edwards is a dynamic scorer who can keep games close single-handedly.
2. **Total**: Both teams have strong defensive players (Gobert, McDaniels for MIN; Dort, Holmgren for OKC). This could lead to a lower-scoring game, especially in a playoff context.
3. **Moneyline**: At +235 to +240, Minnesota offers significant value if you believe they can win outright, but this is higher risk.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

### Game Context:
This also appears to be a playoff game. The Knicks are favored at home with moneyline odds around -225 to -235. The spread is -5.5 points, and the total is set at 226.5-227 points.

### Team Lineup Analysis:
- No lineup data is available for either team, which limits our ability to analyze matchups.

### Statistical Considerations:
- The total of 226.5-227 is higher than the Thunder-Timberwolves game, suggesting oddsmakers expect a more offensive-oriented contest.
- The 5.5-point spread indicates a closer expected game than the Thunder-Timberwolves matchup.
- Without lineup information, it's difficult to assess how injuries or rotations might impact this game.

### Betting Opportunities:
1. **Spread**: The 5.5-point spread offers value if you believe the Pacers can keep it close or if you think the Knicks will win decisively.
2. **Total**: The high total of 226.5-227 could present an opportunity if you have reason to believe the game will be more defensive than anticipated.
3. **Moneyline**: Pacers at +185 to +190 offers decent value if you believe they can win outright.

## Overall Betting Strategy

Without specific statistical edges mentioned in the data provided, I'll focus on analyzing the available information to identify potential value bets:

1. For the Thunder-Timberwolves game:
   - The spread of 7.5 points seems high for a playoff game between two defensive-minded teams.
   - The total of 216.5-217.5 could be worth looking at for an under bet, given both teams' defensive capabilities.

2. For the Knicks-Pacers game:
   - Without lineup information, this is more speculative, but the total of 226.5-227 seems high and could offer value on the under.

Now, let me formulate specific bet recommendations:

### Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves

1. **Minnesota +7.5 (-112) at FanDuel**: This is a substantial playoff spread, and Minnesota has the defensive capability and star power in Edwards to keep this game closer than 7.5 points.

2. **Under 217.5 (-110) at BetMGM**: Both teams have strong defensive identities, and playoff games often see tighter defense and lower scoring.

### New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

1. **Under 227 (-110) at DraftKings/FanDuel**: Without knowing the lineups, this is more speculative, but playoff games often trend toward the under, and this total is relatively high.

2. **Indiana +5.5 (-108) at FanDuel**: Playoff games are often closer than regular season games, and the 5.5-point spread offers some value.

For my final recommendations, I'll assess confidence levels for each bet and assign stakes accordingly, using the 1-5 unit scale as requested.
