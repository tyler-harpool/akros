## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 | Best market odds available; playoff games often tighten in later quarters as defensive intensity increases |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Knicks | -225 (DraftKings) | 2 | Best price among bookmakers; if Knicks have early deficit but showing positive signs, this offers value |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 215.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 3 | Higher line than other books (214.5); playoff games typically see defensive adjustments as they progress |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 226.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 | Lowest total among bookmakers; if early pace is fast, this presents opportunity |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +6 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 | Extra half-point of cushion compared to other books' +5.5; valuable if Pacers showing competitive play |
