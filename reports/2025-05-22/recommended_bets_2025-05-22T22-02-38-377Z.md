## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | The extra half-point provides critical value in what could be a competitive game. Minnesota's starting five has enough defensive presence with Gobert to potentially keep the margin within single digits. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 (FanDuel) | 2 | Significant odds discrepancy between bookmakers creates value at FanDuel, offering the best potential return on the underdog. Worth a moderate stake as a value play. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 226.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 4 | The highest total line available across all bookmakers provides optimal value for an under bet. The 1-point discrepancy between books suggests uncertainty in the scoring projection. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Prop | Under 217.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 | Both teams feature strong defensive anchors (Gobert/Holmgren), and playoff-intensity games often trend under. The half-point advantage over other books justifies the slightly worse odds. |

These recommendations focus on exploiting the discrepancies between bookmakers while considering the limited team information available. The staking levels reflect confidence based on the relative value identified in each market.
