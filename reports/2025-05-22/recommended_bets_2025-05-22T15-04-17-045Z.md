## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -112 | 3 | Minnesota's defensive prowess with Gobert and McDaniels plus Edwards' scoring ability should keep this playoff game closer than 7.5 points |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 217.5 | -110 | 2 | Both teams feature elite defensive personnel, and playoff intensity typically leads to tighter defensive contests |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 226.5 | -105 | 2 | BetMGM offers the best value with the half-point lower total and reduced juice; playoff games often trend under due to increased defensive intensity |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -108 | 2 | Without lineup information, taking the points in what should be a competitive playoff game offers value |

These recommendations balance the available information with typical playoff basketball dynamics, focusing on defensive strengths and the tendency for postseason games to be more competitive and lower-scoring than regular season matchups.
