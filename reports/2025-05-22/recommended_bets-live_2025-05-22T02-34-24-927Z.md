## Thursday, May 22, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 | 4 | IN-GAME value opportunity with significantly better line than FanDuel (-13.5), suggesting bookmakers haven't aligned on how the game will finish |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 236.5 | -118 | 3 | IN-GAME recommendation taking advantage of FanDuel's lower total line, assuming pace will slow in closing minutes |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 | 2 | Best available line for the underdog with extra half-point advantage compared to most books |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Over 214.5 | -108 | 1 | Best price available on the over across all bookmakers, providing slight edge |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so timing is essential when placing these bets. The Knicks-Pacers recommendations are particularly time-sensitive given the game is already in progress.
