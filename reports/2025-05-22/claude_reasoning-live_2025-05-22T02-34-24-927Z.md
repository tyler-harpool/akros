I need to analyze the betting opportunities for the two NBA games provided, with a special focus on the Knicks vs Pacers game which is currently in progress. Let me go through the data systematically:

### Current State of Games

1. **New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers** - This game is IN PROGRESS
   - Based on the moneyline odds (-8500/2000 on DraftKings, -5000/1200 on BetMGM), it appears the Pacers (home team) are heavily favored at this point in the game. These extremely skewed odds suggest they have a commanding lead.
   - The spread odds vary significantly across bookmakers:
     - DraftKings: Pacers -7.5 (114)
     - FanDuel: Pacers -13.5 (-118)
     - BetMGM: Pacers -6.5 (-115)
   - This suggests the Pacers are leading by a significant margin, but there's disagreement about how the rest of the game will play out.
   - Total points over/under ranges from 236.5 to 240.5, with a slight lean toward the under.

2. **Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves** - This game has not started yet (scheduled for 5/23/2025)
   - Thunder are favored (home team) at around -300 to -325 moneyline
   - Spread is consistently around -7.5 to -8 points in favor of Thunder
   - Total points consensus is at 214.5 across all bookmakers

### Key Considerations for In-Progress Game (Knicks vs Pacers)

Without specific information about the current score, time remaining, player performance, or other in-game factors, I need to infer the situation from the odds:

1. The very skewed moneyline suggests the Pacers have a near-certain win probability according to bookmakers. This typically means they have a large lead with limited time remaining.

2. The spread variation (from -6.5 to -13.5) is significant and could present an arbitrage opportunity or value based on how I assess the remainder of the game. FanDuel has a much larger spread (-13.5) compared to BetMGM (-6.5).

3. The total points market shows some disagreement with a 4-point range (236.5 to 240.5). This suggests uncertainty about the pace for the remainder of the game.

Without knowing the current score, quarter/time remaining, and other crucial in-game factors, my analysis is somewhat limited. However, I can identify potential value based on the odds discrepancies.

### Value Analysis

**Knicks vs Pacers (In Progress)**:
1. **Spread Opportunity**: The large variation in spreads (-6.5 at BetMGM vs -13.5 at FanDuel) suggests potential value. If I believe the true line should be closer to -10, then the BetMGM -6.5 (-115) for Pacers could be value. Alternatively, if I think the game will tighten, the Knicks +7.5 (-145) at DraftKings might be worth considering.

2. **Totals Opportunity**: With BetMGM offering Over 240.5 (-105) and FanDuel offering Under 236.5 (-118), there's a 4-point middle opportunity. If the final total lands between 237-240, both bets would win. However, without knowing the current game state, this is risky.

**Thunder vs Timberwolves (Upcoming)**:
1. The odds are relatively consistent across bookmakers, suggesting the market is efficient.
2. The spread at DraftKings (-8, -105) for Thunder offers slightly better value than other books if you like the Thunder.
3. FanDuel's +7.5 (-106) for Timberwolves provides the best value if you favor the underdog.

### Live Betting Recommendations

For the Knicks vs Pacers game:

1. **Spread Value**: There's significant value in the BetMGM spread of Pacers -6.5 (-115) compared to the FanDuel spread of -13.5 (-118). That's a 7-point difference at similar pricing. Without knowing the exact game state, this appears to be the most obvious value opportunity.

2. **Totals Consideration**: If the game has been high-scoring and teams are shooting well, the BetMGM Over 240.5 (-105) might offer value. Conversely, if defense has tightened or the pace has slowed, FanDuel's Under 236.5 (-118) could be valuable.

For the Thunder vs Timberwolves game:
Since this game hasn't started yet, it doesn't qualify as a live betting opportunity. The pre-game odds appear relatively efficient across bookmakers.

Let me now formulate my specific betting recommendations, focusing on the live game where there appear to be the most significant discrepancies in the odds.

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value opportunity due to large spread disparity between bookmakers (7 points)

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 (BetMGM) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation based on the higher total line at BetMGM compared to other books

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 1 unit | Best available line for the underdog

Actually, I need to reconsider these recommendations. Without knowing the current state of the Knicks-Pacers game (score, time remaining, momentum), my live betting recommendations carry too much uncertainty. The large odds discrepancies suggest something significant is happening in the game that I don't have information about.

For the Thunder-Timberwolves game, which hasn't started yet, I would need more information about team form, injuries, and matchup dynamics to make strong recommendations.

Given the constraints and uncertainties, I'll focus on identifying the clearest value opportunities based solely on the odds discrepancies while acknowledging the limitations of my analysis:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value opportunity with significantly better line than other bookmakers (-7.5 at DraftKings, -13.5 at FanDuel)

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 (BetMGM) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation as BetMGM offers the highest total, increasing the value of the under

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best available price on the favored home team

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best price available on the over across all bookmakers

With limited information on the current state of the in-progress game and no information on injuries, lineups, or recent form for the upcoming game, these recommendations are based primarily on identifying cross-bookmaker value rather than a deep analysis of the matchups themselves.

I want to refine this further now and be more careful about the live betting recommendations. Since we don't know the current state of the game, we should be more cautious.

Wait, I noticed an issue. I've been assuming the Pacers are the home team in the Knicks-Pacers game, but looking at the listing format "New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers," this suggests the Knicks are home and the Pacers are away. Let me re-interpret the odds:

So the extremely negative moneyline (-8500/-5000) actually favors the Knicks as the home team, meaning they have a commanding lead over the Pacers.

The spread odds show:
- DraftKings: Knicks -7.5 (114)
- FanDuel: Knicks -13.5 (-118)
- BetMGM: Knicks -6.5 (-115)

This indicates the Knicks are leading significantly, with bookmakers expecting them to win by at least 6.5-13.5 points by the end of the game.

With that clarification, let me revise my analysis:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value opportunity as this is the lowest spread available across bookmakers for the clearly leading team

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 (BetMGM) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation as BetMGM offers the highest total line, giving better value for the under

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Competitive price on the favored home team

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best available price on the over across bookmakers

Hmm, I'm still not fully confident in these recommendations given the limited information, particularly for the live game. Let me revise one more time, being more selective and focusing only on the clearest value opportunities:

Let me re-review the listing information. The way the games are listed is:
- "New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers"
- "Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves"

In standard sports listing format, the home team is typically listed second, which would make the Pacers and Thunder the home teams. However, the odds data seems to label the first teams (Knicks and Thunder) as "Home Team." Let me resolve this ambiguity.

Looking at the moneyline odds for the Knicks-Pacers game:
- DraftKings: Home -8500, Away 2000
- BetMGM: Home -5000, Away 1200

These extremely negative odds for the "Home Team" suggest that team (apparently the Knicks) is heavily favored at this point in the game, likely with a large lead.

For the Thunder-Timberwolves game:
- DraftKings: Home -325, Away 260
- FanDuel: Home -320, Away 260
- BetMGM: Home -300, Away 240

These odds also suggest the "Home Team" (Thunder) is favored.

Given this data structure, and the dates provided (the Knicks-Pacers game is on 5/22/2025, while the Thunder-Timberwolves game is on 5/23/2025), I'll proceed with the assumption that the first team listed in each matchup is designated as the home team in the odds data.

With that clarification, my revised bet recommendations are:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value - lowest spread available for the clearly leading team

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 (BetMGM) | 2 units | IN-GAME value - highest total line available, suggesting better value on the under

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available line for the underdog

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best price available on the over

Now, I want to look more deeply at the Knicks-Pacers game, inferring what I can from the odds:

1. The moneyline odds (-8500/2000 on DraftKings) suggest the Knicks have a win probability of approximately 97.7%, indicating they likely have a substantial lead with limited time remaining.

2. The spread variation from -6.5 to -13.5 is interesting. This 7-point difference suggests bookmakers disagree significantly about how the remainder of the game will play out. FanDuel's -13.5 implies the Knicks will continue to dominate, while BetMGM's -6.5 suggests the Pacers might close the gap somewhat.

3. The total points range (236.5 to 240.5) indicates the game has likely been high-scoring to this point, with some uncertainty about the pace for the remainder.

Given these observations, let me revise my recommendations one final time to focus on the clearest value opportunities:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value - significantly better line than FanDuel's -13.5, suggesting the market hasn't settled on how the game will finish

2. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Competitive price on the home favorite

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best available price on the over across bookmakers

The Knicks-Pacers under 240.5 points could also be considered, but without knowing the current score, time remaining, and pace of play, this carries higher uncertainty.

Actually, I want to reconsider this entire analysis because I'm noticing conflicting information about which team is home and which is away. Let me clarify:

For NBA games, the standard format is "Away Team @ Home Team" or "Home Team vs Away Team". The listing format provided is:
- "New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers"
- "Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves"

This would suggest the Knicks and Thunder are the home teams. However, the "Available NBA Betting Lines" section labels these teams as "Home Team" in the odds tables.

Given this consistency, I'll proceed with the understanding that the Knicks and Thunder are indeed the home teams in these matchups.

For the in-progress Knicks-Pacers game:
- The extremely negative moneyline for the Knicks (-8500/-5000) suggests they have a commanding lead
- The spread ranges from Knicks -6.5 (BetMGM) to Knicks -13.5 (FanDuel)
- The total points line ranges from 236.5 (FanDuel) to 240.5 (BetMGM)

Okay, let me focus specifically on the live betting opportunities for the Knicks-Pacers game, which is what's most relevant for this analysis:

1. **Spread Bet**: The large discrepancy between BetMGM's Knicks -6.5 (-115) and FanDuel's Knicks -13.5 (-118) presents a clear opportunity. If the Knicks are leading by around 10-15 points, then BetMGM's line offers significant value. If the lead is closer to 20+ points, then the Pacers +13.5 at FanDuel might be the value play.

2. **Totals Bet**: The 4-point difference between FanDuel's 236.5 and BetMGM's 240.5 suggests uncertainty about the pace for the remainder of the game. Without knowing the current score and time remaining, it's difficult to assess whether the Over or Under presents better value.

For the Thunder-Timberwolves game:
- The odds are relatively consistent across bookmakers
- The Thunder are favored by around 7.5-8 points
- The total points consensus is 214.5

The pre-game odds for Thunder-Timberwolves appear relatively efficient, with only minor variations across bookmakers.

Given all of this analysis, my final recommendations are:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value - significantly better line than other bookmakers, suggesting opportunity if Knicks maintain their lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +13.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 units | IN-GAME value - if game momentum has shifted or if Knicks lead is not as dominant as moneyline suggests

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best available price for the favored home team

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Slight edge with the best price available on the over

The first two bets focus on the live game where there are clear odds discrepancies that could be exploited based on the current game state. The last two bets are more standard pre-game wagers where I've identified minor pricing advantages.

Actually, I think I need to be careful about potentially recommending contradictory bets. Let me finalize my recommendations with this in mind:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value - significantly better line than FanDuel's -13.5, suggesting opportunity if Knicks maintain their lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 240.5 | -125 (BetMGM) | 2 units | IN-GAME value - highest total line available, offering better value on the under if pace slows in late game

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best available price for the favored home team

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Slight edge with the best price available on the over

These recommendations focus on the clearest value opportunities given the limited information available.

I feel pretty good about these recommendations now.

Actually, I need to check one more thing: I want to make sure I'm being rational and internally consistent about the Knicks-Pacers game. I'm essentially operating with some important limitations and assumptions:

1. I don't know the current score.
2. I don't know how much time is remaining.
3. I don't know about any injuries or foul trouble.
4. I don't know about current momentum or shooting trends.

Given these limitations, let me be more cautious with my live betting recommendations:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value due to 7-point spread discrepancy between bookmakers (BetMGM -6.5 vs FanDuel -13.5)

2. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Slight edge with the best price available for the favored home team

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best price available on the over across bookmakers

Hmm, I'm still not entirely satisfied with my recommendation about the Knicks-Pacers spread. Let me think about this more carefully:

The moneyline odds (-8500 DraftKings, -5000 BetMGM) suggest the Knicks have an extremely high win probability, likely meaning they have a substantial lead with limited time remaining.

The spread variations are:
- DraftKings: Knicks -7.5 (114)
- FanDuel: Knicks -13.5 (-118)
- BetMGM: Knicks -6.5 (-115)

The significant 7-point difference between BetMGM and FanDuel suggests either:
1. One bookmaker has not updated their line quickly enough to match the current game state
2. The bookmakers have fundamentally different views on how the remainder of the game will play out

Given the extremely skewed moneyline, the Knicks are almost certainly leading by a substantial margin. If they're up by 20+ points with limited time remaining, the Knicks -6.5 at BetMGM would be a strong value. However, if they're only up by ~10 points with significant time remaining, there's more risk.

Without knowing the exact game state, my confidence in this recommendation is reduced. However, the 7-point spread difference between bookmakers does suggest potential value.

Let me refine my final recommendations:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME opportunity based on significant spread discrepancy between bookmakers, suggesting value if Knicks have a commanding lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 236.5 | -118 (FanDuel) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation assuming time is limited and pace may slow in closing minutes

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Thunder -7.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Best available price for the favored home team

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Slight edge with the best price available on the over

These recommendations balance the potential value opportunities with the inherent uncertainties in live betting analysis without complete game state information.

Okay, looking at these more closely:

For the Knicks-Pacers game, both Knicks -6.5 at BetMGM and Pacers +13.5 at FanDuel could actually be simultaneously valuable if the Knicks are leading by somewhere between 7-13 points. There's a middle opportunity here where both bets could win if the final margin lands in that range. However, without knowing the current score and time remaining, I'm hesitant to recommend both sides.

For Thunder-Timberwolves, I'm recommending the Thunder -7.5 at BetMGM based on marginally better pricing compared to other books, but this is a slim edge at best.

Let me make one final revision to my recommendations to ensure they're clear, logical, and based on the most obvious value opportunities:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value opportunity with significantly better line than other bookmakers, suggesting the market hasn't settled on how the game will finish

2. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available line for the underdog with an extra half-point compared to other bookmakers

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best price available on the over across bookmakers

I think these final recommendations represent the clearest value opportunities given the limited information available, particularly for the in-progress game.

Actually, I'm still not completely confident in my Thunder vs Timberwolves picks since I have no information about team form, injuries, or matchup dynamics. Let me review my final recommendations once more:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value based on large spread discrepancy between bookmakers, suggesting opportunity if Knicks maintain their apparent lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 236.5 | -118 (FanDuel) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation assuming a slowing pace in late-game situations

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available line for the underdog with an extra half-point of value

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Thunder | -300 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | Best price available for the favored home team

I believe these represent the most reasonable value opportunities given the information available, with appropriate caution applied to the live betting recommendations.

Upon final review, the stake of 1 unit on Thunder moneyline at -300 might not offer sufficient value for the risk. Let me revise to focus on the clearest opportunities:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value based on 7-point spread discrepancy between bookmakers, suggesting significant opportunity if Knicks maintain their apparent lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 236.5 | -118 (FanDuel) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation assuming a slowing pace in late-game situations

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available line for the underdog with an extra half-point of value

These represent the clearest value opportunities given the limited information available.

Actually let me check once more about those cross-book opportunities in the Knicks-Pacers game:

1. Spread opportunity: BetMGM offers Knicks -6.5 (-115) while FanDuel offers Knicks -13.5 (-118)
   - This 7-point gap is significant and suggests potential value
   - If the Knicks are leading by 15+ points, the -6.5 line offers tremendous value
   - If the Knicks are leading by around 10 points, both the Knicks -6.5 and Pacers +13.5 could potentially win (middle opportunity)

2. Totals opportunity: FanDuel offers 236.5 (Under -118) while BetMGM offers 240.5 (Over -105)
   - This 4-point gap creates a potential middle where both bets could win if the final total falls between 237-240 points
   - Without knowing the current score and time remaining, this is a more speculative play

The spread opportunity seems clearer and more compelling, particularly the Knicks -6.5 at BetMGM if they have a substantial lead already.

I'll finalize my recommendations as follows:

RECOMMENDED BETS:

1. Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -6.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 3 units | IN-GAME value based on 7-point spread discrepancy between bookmakers, suggesting significant opportunity if Knicks maintain their apparent lead

2. Knicks vs Pacers | Totals | Under 236.5 | -118 (FanDuel) | 2 units | IN-GAME recommendation assuming a slowing pace in late-game situations with lowest total line available

3. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +8 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available line for the underdog with an extra half-point of value

4. Thunder vs Timberwolves | Totals | Over 214.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best price available on the over across bookmakers

These represent the clearest value opportunities given the information available, with appropriate emphasis on the apparent discrepancies in the live game odds.
