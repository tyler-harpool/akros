## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 214.5 | -110 | 3 units | Both teams feature elite defensive personnel (Gobert, McDaniels, Dort, Holmgren) and the Thunder can control pace effectively at home. Playoff-intensity games typically trend under. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves | Spread | Timberwolves +7.5 | -108 | 2 units | While OKC deserves favorite status, Minnesota's defensive identity and Edwards' scoring ability should keep this competitive. Line appears slightly inflated. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 226.5 | -115 | 2 units | Historical matchup data suggests a faster pace. Both BetMGM and DraftKings have set relatively high totals, and the slight difference indicates potential value on the over. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -105 | 1 unit | Road underdogs consistently provide value in the NBA, especially with the more favorable -105 odds at BetMGM compared to DraftKings' -110. |

These recommendations balance risk across different markets while focusing on the strongest statistical edges. Staking is proportional to confidence level based on available information.
