## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Nuggets (10/24/2025) | Moneyline | Warriors | -112 | 4 | Warriors at home as slight favorites against Denver offers tremendous value. Golden State has historically dominated at Chase Center, and this near pick'em price doesn't properly account for their home-court advantage. |
| Bulls vs Pistons (10/23/2025) | Spread | Bulls +2 | -110 | 3 | Market is overreacting to projected Pistons improvement. Chicago as a home underdog represents value, as home teams typically receive a 3-4 point advantage in power ratings. This line suggests a significant and possibly exaggerated shift in team strength. |
| Cavaliers vs Knicks (12/25/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers +2.5 | -110 | 2 | Christmas Day games often see motivated underdogs perform well. Cleveland has the talent to keep this close or win outright, and holiday showcase games tend to be more competitive than regular season contests. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/2025) | Total | Under 227 | -112 | 3 | This total appears inflated for a Christmas Day game featuring the defensive-minded Thunder. San Antonio should still be developing their offensive identity, and high-profile games often feature more deliberate, half-court offensive sets. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 3 | Lakers at home as only slight favorites against Houston represents value. As part of the holiday showcase, the Lakers should be highly motivated, and this line doesn't properly account for their projected talent advantage and home court. |

Remember to monitor these games as they approach for any lineup changes, injuries, or other factors that might affect your betting strategy.
