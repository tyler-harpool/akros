## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 (DK) | 3 units | DraftKings offers better value than FanDuel's -1.5 spread. In what projects as a close game, the half-point difference provides significant value, especially for a home Lakers team likely to receive favorable whistles in late-game situations. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/2025) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 (FD) | 4 units | FanDuel's half-point advantage over DraftKings' -10 spread provides key value in this Christmas Day showcase. The Thunder project as significant favorites, and Christmas games historically favor elite teams covering against rebuilding ones. |
| Bulls vs Pistons (10/23/2025) | Moneyline | Bulls | +110 (DK) | 2 units | Chicago as home underdogs presents clear value. The +110 price undervalues home court advantage in what appears to be a close matchup, especially early in the season when home teams typically outperform expectations. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FD) | 3 units | Significant discrepancy between FanDuel's -190 and DraftKings' -218 creates value. Denver's home court advantage at altitude remains one of the strongest in the NBA, particularly against division rivals in showcase games. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 226.5 | -110 (FD) | 2 units | Christmas Day games historically feature higher scoring as teams showcase offensive talents. Both teams have traditionally played uptempo basketball, and the prime-time slot incentivizes entertaining, high-scoring basketball. |

Remember that these recommendations are based on current odds for future games. As we get closer to these dates, injury information and team performance data will allow for more refined betting approaches.
