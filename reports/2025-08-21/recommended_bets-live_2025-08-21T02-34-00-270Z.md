## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -110 | 3 | Bet if Thunder trail by 5+ points in 1st quarter. OKC typically makes excellent defensive adjustments after slow starts and has significantly more talent to overcome early deficits. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Spread | Lakers -3.5 | -110 | 3 | Bet if Lakers trail at halftime despite shooting below their season average. Lakers' veteran leadership typically leads to stronger second-half performance and shooting regression. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Total | Under 222 | -110 | 2 | Bet if first quarter features 60+ combined points. Both teams have elite defenses that typically tighten as games progress, especially in competitive matchups. |
| Spurs vs Mavericks | Spread | Spurs +1 | -102 | 2 | Bet if game is within 5 points at halftime. The even moneyline (-110/-110) but slight spread advantage suggests value on Spurs if they can keep it close early. |
| Timberwolves vs Blazers | Spread | Timberwolves -2.5 | -110 | 3 | Bet if game is tied or within 3 points at halftime. Minnesota has superior talent that should assert itself in second half, particularly if their shooting percentage is below season average early. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so be prepared to act decisively when these specific situations arise during the actual games. These recommendations are based on typical team tendencies and matchup dynamics that should be reconfirmed when the games actually take place.
