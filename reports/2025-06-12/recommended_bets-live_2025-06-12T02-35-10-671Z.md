## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -315 | 3 | IN-GAME recommendation taking advantage of the substantial odds discrepancy between bookmakers (DK -315 vs FD -520), suggesting significant value on DraftKings' price |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -122 | 2 | IN-GAME value play exploiting the 1-point spread difference between bookmakers. FanDuel's +6.5 provides crucial extra cushion compared to DraftKings' +5.5 |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -125 | 2 | IN-GAME recommendation capitalizing on DraftKings offering a full point less than FanDuel's -6.5 spread, creating value if Thunder maintain or extend their advantage |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 227.5 | -115 | 1 | IN-GAME conservative play based on Thunder's elite defense potentially slowing the pace against Indiana's typically fast offense. Both books agree on this total, suggesting market consensus |

Note: These recommendations are based on odds discrepancies rather than specific game state information. For most effective live betting, incorporate current score, time remaining, momentum, and player performance into your decision-making.
