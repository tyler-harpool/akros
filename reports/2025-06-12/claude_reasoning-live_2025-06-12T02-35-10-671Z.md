Let me analyze the current situation for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game that's in progress.

Based on the information provided, this is a live in-game betting scenario. Let me assess what we know:

1. The game is currently in progress (Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder)
2. Current odds suggest OKC is favored:
   - Moneyline: Thunder are heavy favorites (-315 on DraftKings, -520 on FanDuel)
   - Spread: Thunder -5.5 on DraftKings, -6.5 on FanDuel
   - Totals: 227.5 points on both DraftKings and FanDuel

What I don't have from the information provided:
- Current score
- Current time/quarter
- Recent momentum
- Any injury updates since the game started
- Player foul trouble
- How the teams have been playing (shooting percentages, turnovers, etc.)

Without this critical in-game information, it's challenging to make precise live betting recommendations. However, I can still analyze the betting lines and look for potential value based on what we know.

Let's analyze the odds discrepancies first:

**Moneyline Discrepancy:**
- DraftKings has Thunder at -315, Pacers at +230
- FanDuel has Thunder at -520, Pacers at +350

This is a significant difference between the two bookmakers. FanDuel is giving the Thunder a much higher implied probability of winning than DraftKings. This suggests there might be value on the Thunder moneyline at DraftKings (-315) or on the Pacers moneyline at FanDuel (+350).

**Spread Discrepancy:**
- DraftKings: Thunder -5.5 (-125), Pacers +5.5 (-105)
- FanDuel: Thunder -6.5 (-108), Pacers +6.5 (-122)

There's a 1-point difference in the spread, with DraftKings offering Thunder -5.5 and FanDuel offering Thunder -6.5. This suggests potential value on Thunder -5.5 at DraftKings or Pacers +6.5 at FanDuel, depending on game flow.

**Totals:**
- Both bookmakers have the total at 227.5 points with nearly identical odds.

Now, let's think about typical in-game betting scenarios:

1. **Momentum Shifts:** If one team is currently on a run, bookmakers sometimes overreact in the short term. For example, if the Thunder have recently gone on a 10-0 run, the lines might be inflated in their favor, potentially creating value on the Pacers.

2. **Foul Trouble:** If key players (like SGA for Thunder or Haliburton for Pacers) are in foul trouble, this could significantly impact the remainder of the game.

3. **Pace of Play:** If the game is being played at a faster or slower pace than expected, this could affect the total.

4. **Shooting Variance:** If teams are shooting unusually well or poorly, this might regress to the mean as the game continues.

Based on the limited information, here are some potential betting angles:

1. **Moneyline Arbitrage:** The large discrepancy between DraftKings and FanDuel suggests potential arbitrage opportunity, though this would require betting on both sides.

2. **Spread Value:** The 1-point difference in spreads suggests taking Thunder -5.5 on DraftKings or Pacers +6.5 on FanDuel might offer value, depending on game context.

3. **Totals Consistency:** Since both bookmakers agree on the total, there's no obvious edge there without knowing the current game state and pace.

For my recommended bets, I'll need to make some educated guesses about the game state. I'll assume:
- The game is relatively close (within the spread)
- Both teams have their key players available
- We're not in the final minutes where strategies change significantly

Based on these assumptions and the odds discrepancies, here are my tentative recommendations:

1. Consider Pacers +6.5 (-122) on FanDuel - The 1-point difference from DraftKings suggests value.
2. Consider Thunder ML (-315) on DraftKings - Much better odds than FanDuel's -520.
3. Potentially look at live player props if available, focusing on key players like SGA, Haliburton, and Holmgren.

However, without current game state information, these recommendations come with significant caveats. Live betting is highly dependent on the current situation in the game.

I'm seeing now that I don't have enough specific in-game information to make confident recommendations. In a real live betting scenario, we would want to know:
- Current score
- Time remaining
- Recent scoring trends
- Player performance so far
- Foul situation
- Any tactical adjustments made

Without this information, I can only identify potential value based on odds discrepancies between bookmakers, which is not ideal for live betting recommendations.

Let me now construct my response, being transparent about these limitations while still providing the best analysis possible with the information available.

I will:
1. Acknowledge the limited in-game information
2. Analyze the odds discrepancies
3. Provide general live betting strategies for this matchup
4. Make a few tentative recommendations based on the odds differences
5. Format these as requested in a RECOMMENDED BETS section

Since I need to provide 3-5 specific recommendations, I'll focus on the clearest opportunities based on the odds discrepancies, while acknowledging the limitations.
