## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -6 | -110 | 3 | Thunder's superior defensive structure with Holmgren and Dort should contain Pacers' offense enough to cover this margin |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 2 | Thunder's defense can disrupt Pacers' rhythm, and playoff-style intensity often reduces scoring efficiency |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -230 | 4 | SGA's ability to take over games in critical moments gives Thunder a significant edge in close situations |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Team Total | Pacers Under (if available) | N/A | 2 | Thunder's perimeter defense and rim protection matches up well against Pacers' offensive strengths |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so these recommendations are time-sensitive. Consider the current game flow, momentum, and any player foul trouble before placing these bets.
