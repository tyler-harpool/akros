## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6 | -110 | 3 | Home underdogs typically perform better than expected, and DraftKings offers fair juice for this selection. The 6-point cushion provides value in what should be a competitive atmosphere. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Totals | Under 225.5 | -108 | 2 | The Thunder have developed into a strong defensive team, while playoff-caliber matchups often see tighter defense and more deliberate possessions, particularly in clutch situations. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +188 | 1 | While Indiana is a clear underdog, FanDuel offers better value (+188 vs +180) for a small-stake calculated risk on the home team potentially rising to the occasion. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread (Alt) | Thunder -6 | -108 | 1 | If backing the favorite, FanDuel offers better juice (-108 vs -110) for the Thunder to cover, making this the optimal book for this selection. |

These recommendations balance risk and potential reward based on the available market data, focusing on finding value through shop comparison and fundamental basketball principles.
