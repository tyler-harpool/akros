## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 units | FanDuel offers significantly better value than DraftKings (-218). Denver historically strong at home, and this 28-point odds difference represents major value. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 3 units | DraftKings offers a better line than FanDuel's -1.5. The half-point difference is crucial in what projects as a tight game, providing valuable insurance against a 1-point win. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/2025) | Total | Over 226.5 | -110 | 3 units | FanDuel's total is a point higher than DraftKings (225.5), suggesting value on the over. Christmas games typically feature more offense and both teams have strong scoring potential. |
| Pistons vs Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Moneyline | Pistons | 105 | 2 units | Home underdog offering plus money against a Cavaliers team laying only -125. The narrow spread (-1.5) suggests this game is essentially a coin flip, making the plus-money home team attractive. |
| Timberwolves vs Nuggets (10/28/2025) | Total | Under 221.5 | -110 | 2 units | This is the lowest total among all games analyzed, suggesting bookmakers expect a defensive battle. Minnesota and Denver have historically played tight, lower-scoring games, making the under attractive. |

Note that these recommendations focus on identifying value in the current odds rather than projecting specific game outcomes, given the limited information about team compositions for the upcoming season. Adjustments should be made closer to game time based on injuries, lineup changes, and recent team performance.
