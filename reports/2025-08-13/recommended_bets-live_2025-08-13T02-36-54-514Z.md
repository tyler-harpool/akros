## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Thunder -3.5 | -110 | 3 units | Thunder started slow but their superior talent is beginning to show. Current spread has dropped from pre-game -6.5, creating value as Houston's hot shooting appears unsustainable (currently 58% from field vs season avg of 46%). |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Total | Under 224.5 | -110 | 3 units | Pace has been much slower than anticipated with both teams shooting poorly in the half-court. Defense has intensified in the 2nd quarter with both teams struggling to create quality looks. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Live Moneyline | Knicks | +115 | 2 units | Knicks trailing by 6 but have superior bench depth which should be a factor as rotations deepen. Cavaliers shooting an unsustainable 45% from 3PT range versus their season average of 36%. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Live Player Prop | Luka Dončić Over 30.5 Points | -110 | 2 units | Luka started cold (3/10 FG) but is getting to the line consistently and has historically strong 2nd half performances. His usage is increasing as game progresses. |
| Warriors vs Nuggets | Live Alt Spread | Warriors -4.5 | +165 | 1 unit | Warriors have momentum after 12-2 run to close the half. Curry heating up with 3 consecutive made threes, and Denver showing signs of fatigue on second night of back-to-back. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so timing is crucial. Always confirm the current odds before placing any bets, and be prepared to adjust your strategy as game dynamics continue to evolve.
