## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant 28-point difference between bookmakers (DK at -218, FD at -190) creates clear value opportunity on FanDuel for the home favorite Nuggets. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder (1/19/26) | Moneyline | Thunder | -110 | 3 | Even matchup pricing undervalues the Thunder who project as Western Conference contenders. Pick'em nature of this game offers value on the emerging Thunder even on the road. |
| Houston Rockets vs Golden State Warriors (11/27/25) | Moneyline | Warriors | -105 | 2 | Warriors as slight road underdogs represents value against a less established Rockets team. The near even spread (-1) indicates the Warriors moneyline at -105 offers positive expected value. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Mavericks | -110 | 3 | Even pricing in a matchup that should favor the more established Mavericks against a rebuilding Spurs team offers value opportunity. The tiny -1 spread indicates market uncertainty that doesn't account for Dallas's talent advantage. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/25) | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 | 2 | Line discrepancy between bookmakers (DK at -1, FD at -1.5) indicates market uncertainty. The Rockets getting points at home as the younger, improving team offers value against the aging Lakers. |

Remember to monitor these lines as game dates approach, as odds will shift based on team performance, injuries, and public betting patterns.
