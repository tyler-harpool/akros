## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets ML | -190 | 4 | Significant 28-cent difference between books (DK -218 vs FD -190) creates immediate value on FanDuel for the home Nuggets in a post-Christmas matchup where they should have a rest and preparation advantage. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 | 3 | Even moneyline (-110 both ways) indicates a competitive, potentially defensive battle. Rivalry games between these Texas teams historically trend toward lower-scoring affairs when closely matched. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves vs Denver Nuggets (10/28/2025) | Spread | Timberwolves -1.5 | -110 | 3 | Minnesota's small home favorite status with a tight spread suggests oddsmakers see minimal separation. The relatively low 221.5 total indicates a defensive game where 1.5 points provides significant value. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Total | Under 224.5 | -110 | 2 | Post-Christmas games historically show offensive regression. The narrow spread (-1) and low total (compared to other games) suggest a competitive, defense-oriented contest. DraftKings' total is a full point higher than FanDuel's, creating value. |
| Detroit Pistons vs Cleveland Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers -1.5 | -110 | 2 | Cleveland is favored on the moneyline (-125) but only needs to win by 2+ points against a traditionally weaker Pistons team. This alignment of moneyline and spread creates a favorable bet structure. |
