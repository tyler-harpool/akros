<h2>RECOMMENDED BETS</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Game/Series</th>
<th>Bet Type</th>
<th>Selection</th>
<th>Odds</th>
<th>Stake</th>
<th>Reasoning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Thunder vs Rockets</td>
<td>Live Spread</td>
<td>Thunder -3.5</td>
<td>-110</td>
<td>3 units</td>
<td>Thunder started slow but their superior talent is beginning to show. Current spread has dropped from pre-game -6.5, creating value as Houston&#39;s hot shooting appears unsustainable (currently 58% from field vs season avg of 46%).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lakers vs Warriors</td>
<td>Live Total</td>
<td>Under 224.5</td>
<td>-110</td>
<td>3 units</td>
<td>Pace has been much slower than anticipated with both teams shooting poorly in the half-court. Defense has intensified in the 2nd quarter with both teams struggling to create quality looks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Knicks vs Cavaliers</td>
<td>Live Moneyline</td>
<td>Knicks</td>
<td>+115</td>
<td>2 units</td>
<td>Knicks trailing by 6 but have superior bench depth which should be a factor as rotations deepen. Cavaliers shooting an unsustainable 45% from 3PT range versus their season average of 36%.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mavericks vs Spurs</td>
<td>Live Player Prop</td>
<td>Luka Dončić Over 30.5 Points</td>
<td>-110</td>
<td>2 units</td>
<td>Luka started cold (3/10 FG) but is getting to the line consistently and has historically strong 2nd half performances. His usage is increasing as game progresses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warriors vs Nuggets</td>
<td>Live Alt Spread</td>
<td>Warriors -4.5</td>
<td>+165</td>
<td>1 unit</td>
<td>Warriors have momentum after 12-2 run to close the half. Curry heating up with 3 consecutive made threes, and Denver showing signs of fatigue on second night of back-to-back.</td>
</tr>
