## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Spread | Spurs +1 | -115 | 3 | Nearly even moneyline but Spurs getting a point, suggesting value on the underdog in what bookmakers view as an extremely close matchup. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Moneyline | Rockets | +104 | 2 | Very tight spread with plus-money on Houston indicates a close contest where the underdog offers value. FanDuel's odds are particularly attractive. |
| Warriors vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +1 | -115 | 3 | Extremely tight odds in this marquee matchup with Denver getting a point. Nuggets' consistent quality makes this spread value proposition appealing. |
| Timberwolves vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Nuggets | +102 | 2 | Minnesota is only slightly favored at home despite Denver's perennial contender status. At plus-money, Nuggets offer value in this closely rated matchup. |
| Cavaliers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder +1 | -115 | 3 | Even moneyline with Cavs getting slight home advantage in the spread. Thunder's projected strength makes them attractive getting a point in what's essentially a pick'em game. |

When these games go live, watch for early game flow patterns that might contradict the pre-game expectations, as these can create excellent live betting opportunities.
