## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -110 | 4 | OKC's ball movement is creating open looks while Houston's offense is stagnating. Thunder's second unit is outplaying Rockets' bench, suggesting the lead will grow as the game progresses. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Moneyline | Warriors | 136 | 3 | Warriors' shooting and pace advantages haven't been fully factored into this line. Golden State's depth gives them an edge against a Lakers team that's struggled in transition defense. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Total | Under 222 | -110 | 3 | Early playoff-like intensity expected between these rivals with both teams focusing on defensive execution. These teams have gone under in 7 of their last 10 meetings. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Moneyline | Mavericks | -110 | 2 | Even line doesn't properly account for Dallas' experience advantage in close games. Mavericks' superior half-court execution will be crucial in a tight contest. |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Total | Over 224.5 | -110 | 3 | Pace has been faster than anticipated with both teams pushing in transition. Thunder's efficient shooting and Rockets' defensive lapses suggest scoring will increase in the second half. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as lines move rapidly in response to game events. The recommendations above represent value based on current game states and betting markets.
