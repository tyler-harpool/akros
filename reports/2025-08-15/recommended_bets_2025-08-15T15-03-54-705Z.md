## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Dallas Mavericks | -110 | 4 | Despite the even odds, Dallas projects to remain superior with Luka Doncic as their centerpiece while San Antonio will still be developing. This coin-flip pricing undervalues Dallas's established star power. |
| Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic (11/26/25) | Spread | 76ers +1 | -110 | 3 | Market expectation that Orlando surpasses Philadelphia by late 2025 seems premature. The 76ers' established stars should still provide enough firepower to keep them competitive against a developing Magic team. |
| New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers (12/25/25) | Spread | Knicks -2.5 | -110 | 3 | The Christmas Day atmosphere at Madison Square Garden provides a significant home court advantage. The Knicks historically elevate their play in marquee holiday matchups, making this small spread attractive. |
| Orlando Magic vs Miami Heat (10/22/25) | Total | Over 207 | -110 | 2 | This total is exceptionally low by modern NBA standards. Even with both teams' defensive reputations, the league-wide scoring trend should push this game over this modest number. |
| Houston Rockets vs San Antonio Spurs (11/8/25) | Spread | Rockets -3 | -110 | 3 | Houston's young core (Green, Sengun, etc.) should be entering their prime by the 2025-26 season, while San Antonio may still be rebuilding. The small spread doesn't fully account for Houston's projected development curve. |

These selections provide diversified exposure across different bet types and represent the strongest value propositions based on current market prices and projected team trajectories.
