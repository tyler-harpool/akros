## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Detroit Pistons (11/26/2025) | Spread | Celtics -1 | -110 | 4 units | Defending champions are significantly undervalued at only -1 at home against a Detroit team still rebuilding. Boston's championship pedigree and home court advantage aren't properly reflected in this line. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/2025) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -118 | 3 units | Lakers have true home court advantage in this shared arena matchup. The line doesn't account for the Lakers' stronger home crowd support and projected roster strength. |
| Houston Rockets vs Denver Nuggets (11/22/2025) | Spread | Nuggets +3.5 | -110 | 3 units | Denver has been a Western Conference powerhouse with a proven core. This line overvalues Houston's projected improvement while underestimating Denver's consistency and experience. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 units | Warriors are rarely underdogs at Chase Center. This line fails to properly account for Golden State's significant home court advantage and playoff-experienced roster. |
| Cleveland Cavaliers vs Oklahoma City Thunder (1/19/2026) | Spread | Thunder +1 | -115 | 2 units | Thunder's young core continues to develop and projects as the stronger overall team in 2025-26. There's value getting OKC as road underdogs in what should be a pick'em or better. |

These recommendations focus on spread values that appear mispriced based on team projections, home court advantages, and roster construction. The staking plan reflects confidence levels in each selection, with higher units assigned to bets with stronger perceived edges.
