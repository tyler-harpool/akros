## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/25) | Spread | Celtics -2 | -110 | 3 units | Boston's historically strong home court advantage against Eastern Conference rivals makes this 2-point spread seem undervalued. The Celtics typically perform well in this matchup at home. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Mavericks +1 | -102 | 2 units | Getting the Mavericks at plus points with favorable -102 odds represents value in what bookmakers see as an even matchup. The Mavs' offensive firepower should keep this game close at minimum. |
| Orlando Magic vs Miami Heat (10/22/25) | Total | Under 207 | -110 | 2 units | This is one of the lowest totals on the board, but both Florida teams have historically emphasized defensive schemes and played at controlled paces against each other. The under appears to have value. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 | 3 units | FanDuel's 9.5-point spread offers better value than DraftKings' 10-point line. OKC should be a developed contender by the Christmas showcase, while the Spurs may still be developing cohesion. The prime-time spotlight should motivate the Thunder to perform. |
| Minnesota Timberwolves vs Denver Nuggets (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 2 units | FanDuel's -190 represents better value than DraftKings' -218 for the same bet. Denver has historically performed well against Minnesota, and the post-Christmas scheduling spot favors the more experienced Nuggets team. |

These recommendations are based on historical team tendencies, perceived market inefficiencies, and traditional matchup dynamics. As the season approaches, bettors should monitor team news, injuries, and preseason performance to refine these positions.
