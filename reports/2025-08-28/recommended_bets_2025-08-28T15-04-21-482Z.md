## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 units | Significant price difference between bookmakers (FanDuel -190 vs DraftKings -218) offers clear value on the home favorite |
| Boston Celtics @ New York Knicks (10/24/25) | Spread | Boston Celtics +6.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Spread appears too large given Boston's traditional strength; the Celtics typically perform well as underdogs |
| Orlando Magic @ Philadelphia 76ers (11/26/25) | Total | Under 214.5 | -110 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Both teams have historically favored defensive approaches and slower pace; this total is already low but still offers value |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Dallas Mavericks -1 | -102 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Even moneyline with a 1-point spread indicates value, especially with reduced juice at -102 rather than standard -110 |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Spurs +10 | -115 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Half-point advantage over FanDuel's +9.5 line provides crucial value in a Christmas Day game where spreads tend to be inflated |

These recommendations target pricing inefficiencies across different bookmakers and bet types, focusing on situations where the odds appear mispriced relative to the expected game dynamics.
