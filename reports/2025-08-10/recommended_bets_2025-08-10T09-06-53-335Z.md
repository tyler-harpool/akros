## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Mavericks @ Warriors | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Full point advantage over DraftKings' +3.5 line. The 4-point margin is a key threshold in NBA games, making this extra point extremely valuable. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Spread | Nuggets -4.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Better price than DraftKings' -5 (-115) with half-point advantage. Denver historically strong at home and line suggests they're favored by 2-3 possessions. |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Extra half-point over DraftKings' +1 in what projects to be the closest game on the slate. In tight matchups, every half-point carries significant value. |
| Cavaliers @ Knicks | Spread | Cavaliers +3 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Getting the full 3 points versus FanDuel's +2.5 is crucial as 3-point margins are common in NBA. Key number advantage at a reasonable price. |
| Thunder vs Spurs | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Significant 1.5-point difference from DraftKings' 227 total. Thunder projecting as heavy favorites (-9.5) suggests potential for a controlled pace if they establish an early lead. |

Remember to always verify lines before placing bets as odds may change after this analysis. Good luck!
