## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26) | Live Spread | Lakers -4.5 or better if trailing early | -110 | 3 | With pre-game spread of just -1.5 (FD), Lakers as home favorites present value if they fall behind early by 6+ points. The tight spread indicates a close matchup where regression to expected performance is likely. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/26) | Live Moneyline | Thunder if ML drops below -250 after slow start | -405 | 4 | As heavy pre-game favorites (-455 DK), Thunder represent value if they start slowly and their price improves. Significant talent gap should prevail over full game duration. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/26) | Live Spread | Mavericks +7 or better if Warriors start hot | +140 | 2 | The pre-game spread discrepancy (1 point difference between books) indicates uncertainty. If Warriors build early 10+ point lead, look for value on Mavs at an inflated spread. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26) | Live Total | Over if pace is slow in Q1 and live total drops below 224 | -110 | 3 | With high pre-game total (229-230.5), slow start would create value on over if teams are missing shots but generating good looks. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers (12/26) | Live Moneyline | Cavaliers if they trail by 8+ in Q2/Q3 | +130 | 2 | With pre-game spread of just -3 (DK), Cavs would have comeback value if they fall behind by 8+ points but remain within striking distance. Their pre-game ML of +130 would improve significantly in this scenario. |

Remember that in-game betting requires quick decision-making as odds shift rapidly. These recommendations should be adjusted based on actual game flow, player performance, and the specific live odds available at the time.
