## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Total Under | Under 225.5 | -110 | 3 | FanDuel's line is a full point higher than DraftKings (224.5), creating a middle opportunity. Take the higher number for better value. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Spread | Warriors +3.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel offers better odds (-106 vs -110) for the same spread. Warriors matchup well with the Lakers' defense in transition. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 | 3 | Significant value gap between FanDuel (-142) and DraftKings (-155) for the same bet. Home court advantage likely providing momentum. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Spread | Warriors -3.5 | -112 | 4 | Full point advantage over FanDuel's -4.5 spread. This line movement suggests Warriors performing better than expected in recent games. |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 2 | FanDuel offers better value than DraftKings (-205) for the home favorite. Nuggets' home court advantage typically strengthens as games progress. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions based on evolving game situations. Always confirm the current score and momentum before placing these bets, as odds will shift rapidly during play.
