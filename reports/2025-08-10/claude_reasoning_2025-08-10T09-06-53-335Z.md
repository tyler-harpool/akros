Now, I'll identify the most promising betting opportunities based on these analyses. Since I don't have lineup information, injury reports, or team performance data, I'll focus on identifying value based on line discrepancies between bookmakers and general NBA betting principles.

# Best Betting Opportunities:

1. **Mavericks +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel** - This is a full point better than DraftKings' +3.5 line, which is significant in basketball. The point difference between +3.5 and +4.5 is valuable as many NBA games end with a margin of 4 points.

2. **Nuggets -4.5 (-108) at FanDuel** - Compared to DraftKings' -5 (-115), you're getting a better price and a half-point advantage on the spread.

3. **Under 228.5 (-110) on Thunder vs Spurs at FanDuel** - The 1.5-point difference between bookmakers (DraftKings at 227, FanDuel at 228.5) suggests value on the over at DraftKings or the under at FanDuel.

4. **Rockets +1.5 (-112) at FanDuel** - In a game with such a tight spread, getting an extra half-point can be crucial, even with the slightly worse juice.

5. **Cavaliers +3 (-108) at DraftKings** - Getting a full 3 points is valuable in the NBA, where many games end with a 3-point margin.
