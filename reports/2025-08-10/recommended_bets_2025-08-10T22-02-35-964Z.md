## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Moneyline | Warriors | -166 (DK) | 4 | Significant 32-cent difference compared to FanDuel (-198), representing major value while backing the home favorite |
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 (FD) | 3 | Full point advantage over DraftKings spread (+3.5), critical value with the extra point in what should be a competitive game |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 (FD) | 3 | 13-cent improvement over DraftKings odds (-155), meaningful edge for backing the home team |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 230.5 | -110 (FD) | 2 | 1.5 point higher total than DraftKings (229), creating value on the under with the extra cushion |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +1.5 | -112 (FD) | 2 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings (+1), valuable in what projects to be a one-possession game |

These recommendations focus on exploiting odds inefficiencies between bookmakers while maximizing value through superior lines and prices. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection based on the magnitude of the edge identified.
