## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Mavericks | Moneyline | Warriors | -166 | 4 units | Significant value compared to FanDuel's -198 price; 32-point difference in implied probability creates clear edge |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Moneyline | Knicks | -142 | 3 units | 13-point difference between books; FanDuel offers substantially better value than DraftKings' -155 |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Total | Over 229 (DK) | -110 | 2 units | Part of middle opportunity with 1.5 point gap between books; pair with under 230.5 on FanDuel for chance to win both |
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves | Total | Under 230.5 (FD) | -110 | 2 units | Complementary bet to create middle opportunity; win both bets if final score lands at 229 or 230 points |
| Lakers vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +1.5 (FD) | -112 | 3 units | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' line in what appears to be a competitive matchup; key half-point could be decisive |

Remember to always practice responsible bankroll management and adjust these recommendations based on any team news or lineup changes closer to game time.
