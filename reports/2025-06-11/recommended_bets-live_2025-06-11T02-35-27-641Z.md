## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -108 | 3 | DraftKings offers slightly better odds than FanDuel for Thunder ATS. If game is close or Thunder trailing, this represents good value as OKC typically performs well in clutch situations. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +184 | 1 | If Pacers are showing strong offensive rhythm and keeping the game close, FanDuel's +184 offers good underdog value in what could become a high-variance finish. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228.5 | -110 | 2 | If defenses are tightening as the game progresses and scoring pace has slowed from early quarters, the under becomes valuable, especially if teams are in bonus situation leading to clock stoppages. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Thunder -3.5 | -145* | 2 | *If available at approximately these odds. A reduced spread for the Thunder offers a safer option if the game has shown signs of tightening in the second half. |

**Note:** These recommendations assume various game states. For optimal live betting, reassess based on the current score, time remaining, player performance, and momentum shifts.
