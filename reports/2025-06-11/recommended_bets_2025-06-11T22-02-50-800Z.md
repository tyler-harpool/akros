## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 | Home court advantage typically worth 2-3 points, and the Pacers' balanced offense should keep this competitive. Turner's rim protection can help contain Thunder drives. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 226.5 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | Both teams feature elite rim protectors in Holmgren and Turner who can suppress inside scoring. The Thunder's defensive orientation could slow the Pacers' preferred pace. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +190 (DraftKings) | 1 | The implied 34% win probability undervalues the Pacers at home. With Haliburton orchestrating and Siakam/Turner inside, they have paths to victory that warrant a small-stake value play. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread Alt | Thunder -2.5 | +135 (estimated) | 2 | A split the difference approach - Thunder likely win but Pacers keep it close. This alternative spread offers better value than the Thunder moneyline while acknowledging their advantage. |

These recommendations balance the Thunder's overall talent edge against the Pacers' home-court advantage and offensive firepower. The main play focuses on the Pacers covering at home, with complementary bets on the total and moneyline value.
