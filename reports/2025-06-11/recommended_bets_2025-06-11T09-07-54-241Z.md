## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5 | -105 | 3 | The Pacers' home-court advantage and offensive efficiency make them attractive getting 5 points. Haliburton-led teams tend to keep games competitive even against superior opponents. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 228 | -110 | 2 | Both teams possess efficient offenses with the Pacers playing at a faster pace. The matchup dynamics and lack of elite wing defenders for either team should produce a high-scoring affair. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +184 | 1 | While OKC is rightfully favored, the Pacers at home have better than the implied 35% win probability this line suggests. Their frontcourt advantage could be decisive in a potential upset. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | 1H Over 114 | -110 | 2 | Both teams typically start strong offensively, with defensive adjustments coming later. First-half scoring should exceed game-long pace with both starting units at full strength. |

These recommendations balance reasonable risk with identified market inefficiencies, with stakes reflecting confidence levels in each selection.
