## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over DraftKings spread (5.5); Pacers' home court advantage typically worth 2-3 points; Siakam/Turner frontcourt matchup favorable |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 228 | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Pacers' faster pace at home should elevate scoring; both teams feature dynamic offensive guards who can create their own shots |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Prop | Haliburton Over Assists | -110* | 2 units | Against OKC's perimeter defense, Haliburton likely to focus on distribution to Siakam and Turner rather than scoring himself |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +190 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Small value play with home court advantage; implied 34% win probability potentially undervalues Pacers' home performance |

*Note: Exact odds for the player prop weren't provided, but this would be a recommended market to explore given the matchup dynamics.

The most compelling value appears to be on the Pacers covering the spread at home, where they've historically performed well even against stronger opponents. The half-point advantage on FanDuel's spread compared to DraftKings provides additional value in what could be a closely contested game.
