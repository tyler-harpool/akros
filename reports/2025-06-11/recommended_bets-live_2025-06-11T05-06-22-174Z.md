## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5 | -105 | 2 | Pacers' high-tempo offense keeps games close, especially if Haliburton is facilitating well. The slight plus-money edge on the spread offers value. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 228 | -110 | 3 | If Thunder are controlling tempo and forcing Pacers into half-court offense, the total may struggle to reach this number. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -218 | 2 | Despite the juice, if Thunder have established control of the game's rhythm, their execution down the stretch typically prevails. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Thunder -2.5 | -165* | 2 | A reduced spread requirement for the favored Thunder offers value if they're executing well but haven't pulled away yet. |

*Note: The alternate spread odds are estimated as they weren't provided in the original data

For more precise in-game recommendations, I would need current score, time remaining, foul situations, and recent performance metrics for key players on both teams.
