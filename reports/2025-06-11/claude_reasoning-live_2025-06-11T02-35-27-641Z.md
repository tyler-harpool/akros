Let me analyze the provided betting information for the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for June 12, 2025.

First, I need to understand what information I have and what's missing:

1. I have basic betting lines (moneyline, spread, and totals) from DraftKings and FanDuel
2. I don't have the current lineups for either team
3. I don't have injury information
4. I don't have current game state, score, or time remaining, which is critical for live in-game betting analysis
5. I don't have any statistical edges identified
6. I don't have information about current game flow, momentum, or recent events

Given that this is supposed to be a LIVE in-game betting analysis, the lack of current game state information is a significant limitation. Without knowing the current score, time remaining, and how the game has been progressing, it's difficult to make informed live betting recommendations.

Let's work with what we have:

The spread suggests Oklahoma City is favored by 5.5 points, which is a moderate advantage. The moneyline odds (-218/-220 for OKC, +180/+184 for Indiana) align with this spread, indicating OKC is a clear but not overwhelming favorite.

The total of 228.5 points suggests oddsmakers expect a reasonably high-scoring game, which makes sense given both teams' offensive capabilities.

Without more information about the current game state and flow, I need to be extremely cautious with any live betting recommendations. Typically, for live betting, I would want to know:

1. Current score
2. Current quarter/time remaining
3. Which players are on the court
4. Recent momentum (scoring runs, etc.)
5. Foul trouble for key players
6. Shooting performance so far (compared to expected averages)
7. Pace of play relative to expectations

Since I'm lacking this information, my recommendations will be more limited and conditional. I'll focus on some general principles and scenarios that might apply depending on the current game state.

Let's create a few potential recommendations based on different possible game states, but I'll need to be very clear about the conditional nature of these recommendations.

For my RECOMMENDED BETS section, I'll need to make some assumptions about possible game states, while being transparent about these assumptions. This is not ideal for live betting analysis, but it's the best approach given the limited information.

Let me craft 3-5 recommendations that could apply in different common live betting scenarios, while acknowledging the limitations.
