## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Thunder -10.5 | -105 | 3 | DraftKings offers 2 points better than FanDuel's -12.5 line. With OKC in control, this presents IN-GAME value against other books' spreads. |
| OKC vs IND | Total | Over 187.5 | 100 | 4 | FanDuel's total is 4 points lower than competitors with even money odds. Significant IN-GAME value compared to the 191.5 line at other books. |
| OKC vs IND | Total | Under 191.5 | 105 | 3 | BetMGM offers plus money on the under while FanDuel sets the total 4 points lower at -132. This creates a middle opportunity and hedging value for IN-GAME betting. |
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Pacers +12.5 | -140 | 2 | If Thunder rest starters or slow pace with large lead, Pacers could cover this larger spread. IN-GAME recommendation based on potential garbage time scoring. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, and these recommendations are based on the current game state. The large discrepancies between bookmakers indicate market uncertainty, which creates exploitable opportunities for astute bettors. Always check the current odds before placing any bet as they may have changed since this analysis.
