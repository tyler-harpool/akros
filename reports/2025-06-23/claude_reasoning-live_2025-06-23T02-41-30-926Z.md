Let me analyze the live betting opportunities for the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game. First, I need to understand the current state of the game to make informed recommendations.

From the information provided:
- The game is in progress (Indiana Pacers @ Oklahoma City Thunder)
- The moneyline odds heavily favor Oklahoma City (-100000 vs +4000)
- The spread varies between bookmakers:
  - FanDuel: OKC -12.5 (106) / IND +12.5 (-140)
  - DraftKings: OKC -10.5 (-105) / IND +10.5 (-125)
- The total points (over/under) also varies:
  - FanDuel: 187.5 (O: 100, U: -132)
  - DraftKings: 191.5 (O: -110, U: -120)
  - BetMGM: 191.5 (O: -140, U: 105)

The moneyline odds suggest that OKC has a commanding lead in the game, as -100000 indicates an almost certain win at this point (over 99% implied probability). The spread of -10.5 to -12.5 confirms that OKC has a significant lead.

Since I don't have the exact current score, time remaining, or quarter information, I'll need to infer the game state from the odds. The variation in the spread (10.5 vs 12.5) suggests that the bookmakers might be adjusting to recent game flow, and there could be some opportunities here.

Let me analyze the different betting markets:

1. Moneyline: With odds at -100000 for OKC, there's essentially no value here. The game appears to be decided already.

2. Spread:
   - The 2-point difference between FanDuel (-12.5) and DraftKings (-10.5) is notable
   - DraftKings offering OKC -10.5 at -105 is more favorable for an OKC bet than FanDuel's -12.5 at 106
   - For Indiana, FanDuel's +12.5 at -140 is worse than DraftKings' +10.5 at -125 (higher juice for fewer points)

3. Totals:
   - FanDuel has the lowest total at 187.5, while DraftKings and BetMGM have it at 191.5
   - FanDuel's over at 100 (even money) seems appealing compared to DraftKings (-110) and BetMGM (-140)
   - BetMGM's under at 105 is the best price for the under

Without knowing the exact current score and time remaining, it's challenging to make precise recommendations. However, based on the odds discrepancies, here are potential value opportunities:

1. OKC -10.5 (-105) at DraftKings: This seems to offer better value than FanDuel's -12.5.
2. Over 187.5 (100) at FanDuel: This total is 4 points lower than the other books, and at even money, it appears to offer value.
3. Under 191.5 (105) at BetMGM: If you're leaning under, this is clearly the best price.

The current game state suggests OKC is in control. Without more details on the current score, quarter, and pace of play, I'll need to be cautious with my recommendations. I'll focus on the odds discrepancies that present the clearest value.

For my recommendations, I'll consider:
- The large spread suggests OKC has a comfortable lead
- The totals market shows significant variation between books
- The odds indicate a slower or lower-scoring game than expected (totals in high 180s/low 190s)

Let me formulate my specific recommendations based on this analysis:
