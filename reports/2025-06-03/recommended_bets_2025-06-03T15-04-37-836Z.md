## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 | 2 | Nine points provides significant cushion for a Pacers team likely to push pace. DraftKings offers slightly better odds than FanDuel for this selection. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 231 (DraftKings) | -112 | 3 | Both teams likely play uptempo basketball. Taking the lower total line provides half-point advantage over FanDuel's 231.5. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alternate Bet | Middle: Over 231 (DK) & Under 231.5 (FD) | -112/-112 | 1 | Low-risk opportunity to hit middle if game lands exactly on 231 points, with small guaranteed loss if it doesn't. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +320 | 1 | Small-value play on underdog with potential 3.2x return. Limited stake due to Thunder's strong favorite status. |

Without more detailed information about lineups, injuries, and recent performance trends, these recommendations are based primarily on the market assessment and general team profiles. The middle bet strategy carries minimal risk with potential for significant return if the total lands exactly at 231 points.
