## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Best available odds for the spread; 9 points provides cushion even against the superior Thunder team |
| OKC vs IND | Totals | Under 231.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Gives us the highest possible total for an under bet with reasonable odds |
| OKC vs IND | Totals | Over 230.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Paired with the Under 231.5, creates a middle opportunity if game lands at exactly 231 points |
| OKC vs IND | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Best available price for the likely winner, though heavy juice limits value |

These recommendations focus on maximizing value through line shopping and creating a potential middle opportunity with the totals bets. Without more detailed team information, I've kept stakes moderate to reflect the limited information available for this matchup.
