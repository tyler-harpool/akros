# NBA LIVE BETTING Betting Recommendations

## RECOMMENDED BETS
Based on pre-game odds and likely in-game scenarios, here are conditional recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 230.5 | -108 | 3 | If pace is slower than expected and defenses are engaged, the pre-game total offers value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 | 2 | If Pacers are keeping it competitive through first half, the pre-game spread provides cushion |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder ML | -405 | 1 | If Thunder establish a small lead but odds have improved from pre-game, there's value in the favorite |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -180* | 2 | If Thunder appear in control but the alternative spread offers better value than -9 |

*Estimated odds for alternative spread

**Note:** For more precise live betting recommendations, I would need current game state information including score, time remaining, and updated live betting lines. The recommendations above are based on potential scenarios and pre-game odds.
