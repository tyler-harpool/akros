## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9 | -112 | 3 | Better value than -9.5 at FanDuel; half-point could be crucial in a game with a large spread |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 2 | Extra half-point protection compared to DraftKings' +9; valuable insurance in what could be a double-digit win for OKC |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 231 | -108 | 2 | Better odds than FanDuel's -110; high totals often present value to the under as they can be inflated by public perception |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Middle Opportunity | Thunder -9 & Pacers +9.5 | -112/-112 | 1 | Strategic opportunity to win both bets if Thunder wins by exactly 9 points; requires proper bankroll allocation |

The key strategy here is exploiting the half-point difference between bookmakers. Without lineup information, focusing on these structural advantages in the odds themselves provides the clearest path to potential value.
