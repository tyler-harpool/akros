## RECOMMENDED BETS
Based on the limited information available, here are my most reasonable recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +8.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 2 | Thunder may win but covering 8.5 points requires dominance. DraftKings offers slightly better value than FanDuel. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 215.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 2 | Taking advantage of the half-point difference at BetMGM compared to other books. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +290 (BetMGM) | 1 | If game is competitive, this offers the best underdog value across all bookmakers. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -4.5 | +120* | 2 | Reduced spread should have better odds while maintaining Thunder's favorite status. |

*Note: Alt spread odds are estimated as they weren't provided in the data. For true live betting analysis, I would need current game state information to make more precise recommendations.
