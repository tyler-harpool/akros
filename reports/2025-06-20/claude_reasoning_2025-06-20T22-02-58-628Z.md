Let's analyze the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers game scheduled for June 23, 2025. I'll go through the available information and evaluate the betting markets.

First, let's look at what we know:

1. Game: Oklahoma City Thunder (home) vs Indiana Pacers (away)
2. Date: June 23, 2025
3. Betting Lines:
   - Moneyline: OKC heavily favored (-290 to -325) vs Pacers (+235 to +260)
   - Spread: OKC -7.5 across all bookmakers at -110
   - Totals: 214.5 to 215 points

Unfortunately, we're missing several key pieces of information:
- No lineup data is provided for either team
- No injury information is provided
- No statistical edge analysis is available
- No recent form or head-to-head records
- No contextual information about the game (regular season, playoffs, etc.)

Given these limitations, I need to make the best analysis possible with the information provided.

Let's start by analyzing the consensus in the betting markets:

1. Oklahoma City is heavily favored at home (around -300 moneyline odds or 75% implied probability)
2. The spread is consistently set at 7.5 points across all bookmakers
3. The total is set around 214.5-215 points, suggesting a moderate-scoring game

Without team lineup data or statistical analysis, we need to consider some fundamentals:

1. Home court advantage is typically worth about 2-3 points in the NBA
2. The -7.5 spread suggests OKC is considered significantly better than Indiana
3. The consensus across bookmakers is strong, with minimal variation in the lines

Since this game is scheduled for June 2025 (which would likely be NBA Finals time), this is probably a hypothetical future matchup or an exhibition game, as Indiana and OKC are in different conferences and wouldn't meet in June unless it's the Finals.

Let's consider potential value in each betting market:

1. Moneyline:
   - OKC: Best odds at DraftKings (-290)
   - Indiana: Best odds at BetMGM (+260)
   - No significant discrepancies between bookmakers to exploit

2. Spread:
   - Uniform across bookmakers at -7.5 (-110)
   - No arbitrage opportunity or clear edge

3. Totals:
   - Slight variation: FanDuel at 215, others at 214.5
   - Best over odds at DraftKings (-110)
   - Best under odds at BetMGM (-105)

Without more information, making strong recommendations is challenging. However, I can provide some analysis based on the limited data and general NBA betting principles.

Looking at the total points market, BetMGM offers slightly better value on the under at -105 compared to other bookmakers. This small edge might be worth considering if you were leaning toward the under.

For the spread, there's uniform pricing across books, suggesting the market is efficient.

For the moneyline, if you believe in OKC, DraftKings offers marginally better odds than competitors.

Now I'll formulate some recommendations based on this limited information, focusing on the small edges available.
