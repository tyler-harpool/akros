## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +17.5 | +114 | 3 | IN-GAME VALUE: FanDuel offers significantly better odds than DraftKings for the same line. Thunder likely to rest starters with big lead, allowing Pacers to potentially narrow gap in garbage time. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 202.5 | -104 | 2 | IN-GAME VALUE: FanDuel's over odds (-104) show value compared to under (-128), suggesting possible market overreaction to recent defensive stretch. Pace should increase if Pacers need to score quickly. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Pacers +19.5 | +135 | 2 | IN-GAME VALUE: Buying extra points for the underdog provides insurance against minor Thunder runs while capturing value in the alt spread market where overreactions often occur during live betting. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | H2H Q4 | Pacers ML Q4 | +175 | 1 | IN-GAME VALUE: Thunder likely to rest key players in 4th quarter with substantial lead, giving Pacers bench opportunity to win the final frame against Thunder reserves. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, so prices may change by the time you place these bets. Focus on the reasoning rather than the exact odds if they've shifted slightly.
