I need to analyze live in-game betting opportunities for the NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. Since this is live betting, I need to be careful with my recommendations as markets move quickly.

Let's go through the information provided:

1. The game is Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers (6/23/2025, 12:00:00 AM)
2. I have the moneyline, spread, and totals odds from different bookmakers
3. No significant betting edges are detected in the current markets
4. No lineup data is available for either team
5. No injury information is provided

This is quite limited information for a live in-game analysis. Typically for live betting, I would need:
- Current score
- Current quarter/time remaining
- Recent momentum shifts
- Key player performance in the current game
- Any injuries that have occurred during the game

Without this information, it's challenging to make informed live betting recommendations. However, I'll work with what I have.

Looking at the betting lines:

**Moneyline:**
- Oklahoma City (home) is heavily favored across all bookmakers (-345 to -375)
- Indiana (away) is the underdog (+275 to +290)

**Spread:**
- Oklahoma City is favored by 8.5 points across all bookmakers
- The vig varies slightly between bookmakers

**Totals:**
- Two bookmakers have the total at 215 points
- BetMGM has it slightly higher at 215.5

Since this is supposed to be live in-game analysis, I'll have to make some assumptions about the game state. Without actual live information, my recommendations will be more general and based on the odds patterns rather than specific game developments.

For my recommended bets, I'll focus on the slight discrepancies between bookmakers and make some reasonable assumptions about the game state:

1. If the game is close in the early stages, the 8.5 point spread may offer value on the Pacers
2. The total line of 215/215.5 could be exploitable if the game pace is notably different than expected
3. There might be value in the moneyline if one team has shown clear superiority so far

Let me create my recommendations based on these considerations:
