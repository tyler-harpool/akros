Let me analyze the betting opportunities for the upcoming NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers.

First, let's summarize what we know:

### Game Details
- Oklahoma City Thunder vs Indiana Pacers
- Date: June 23, 2025
- Time: 12:00:00 AM

### Available Betting Lines

#### Moneyline Odds
- OKC (Home): -330 (FanDuel), -325 (DraftKings), -375 (BetMGM)
- Indiana (Away): +265 (FanDuel), +260 (DraftKings), +290 (BetMGM)

#### Spread Odds
- OKC: -8.5 points across all bookmakers with slight juice differences
- Indiana: +8.5 points across all bookmakers with slight juice differences

#### Totals (Over/Under)
- FanDuel: 215 points (-108 Over, -112 Under)
- DraftKings: 215 points (-108 Over, -112 Under)
- BetMGM: 215.5 points (-110 Over, -110 Under)

### Limitations in Available Data
- No lineup information is available for either team
- No injury reports are provided
- No statistical edges are mentioned in the analysis
- No information about team performance, recent form, or head-to-head matchups

Given these limitations, I'll need to rely on:
1. Analyzing the betting market itself (line shopping)
2. Evaluating implied probabilities and potential value
3. Looking for discrepancies between bookmakers

Let's start by converting the moneyline odds to implied probabilities:

#### Moneyline Implied Probabilities (after removing vig)
- OKC: 
  - FanDuel: -330 ≈ 76.7% 
  - DraftKings: -325 ≈ 76.5%
  - BetMGM: -375 ≈ 78.9%
- Indiana:
  - FanDuel: +265 ≈ 27.4%
  - DraftKings: +260 ≈ 27.8%
  - BetMGM: +290 ≈ 25.6%

There's about a 2.4% difference in implied probability for OKC between the highest and lowest odds (BetMGM vs DraftKings). This suggests some minor disagreement between bookmakers about the exact chances of OKC winning.

The spread is consistently set at 8.5 points across all bookmakers, which indicates a strong consensus about the expected margin of victory for OKC. The slight differences in juice don't present significant arbitrage opportunities.

For totals, there's a small 0.5 point difference between BetMGM (215.5) and the other bookmakers (215). This could potentially present a small opportunity if we have a strong lean on the total.

Now, even without specific team information, let me try to interpret what these lines tell us:

1. OKC is a significant favorite at home with approximately 77-79% implied probability of winning.
2. The 8.5 point spread suggests a comfortable but not overwhelming advantage for OKC.
3. The total of 215-215.5 points suggests an expected moderate-scoring game by NBA standards.

Based on the betting lines alone, here are potential considerations:

1. **Moneyline Value**: If betting on OKC to win outright, BetMGM offers the worst value at -375. FanDuel (-330) or DraftKings (-325) would be preferable. For Indiana, BetMGM offers the best value at +290.

2. **Spread Value**: FanDuel offers the best value on OKC to cover at -106, while DraftKings offers the best value on Indiana at +8.5 (-112).

3. **Totals Value**: If leaning toward the over, BetMGM's 215.5 at -110 is less favorable than the 215 at -108 offered by FanDuel and DraftKings. Conversely, if leaning toward the under, BetMGM's 215.5 at -110 offers better value than the 215 at -112 from FanDuel or -112 from DraftKings.

Without more context about the teams, recent performance, or lineup information, it's difficult to make strong recommendations. However, I can suggest a few potential bets based solely on the odds comparison:

1. **Value on Indiana's Moneyline**: At BetMGM, Indiana's +290 odds imply about a 25.6% chance of winning. If we believe their true chances are closer to or above 30%, this would represent value.

2. **Total Under at BetMGM**: The half-point difference between BetMGM (215.5) and the other books (215) is significant in NBA totals betting. If we're leaning toward the under, BetMGM's 215.5 at -110 provides better value than the other books.

3. **OKC to Cover the Spread at FanDuel**: At -106, FanDuel offers the best price on OKC to cover the 8.5 point spread compared to other bookmakers.

Given the limited information, I would recommend smaller stakes (1-2 units) on any of these bets rather than maximum confidence plays.

Now, let me formulate my recommended bets based on this analysis:

1. Indiana Pacers Moneyline at BetMGM (+290): The discrepancy between bookmakers suggests potential value, with BetMGM offering significantly better odds than FanDuel (+265) or DraftKings (+260).

2. Under 215.5 Points at BetMGM (-110): Getting the extra half point compared to other bookmakers (215) provides additional value for an under bet.

3. Oklahoma City -8.5 at FanDuel (-106): The best price available for backing the favorite to cover the spread.

4. Indiana Pacers +8.5 at DraftKings (-112): If preferring to back the underdog, this represents the best price available.

Given the lack of team-specific information, I'll keep my stakes conservative at 1-2 units per bet and emphasize the odds-based reasoning rather than team analysis.
