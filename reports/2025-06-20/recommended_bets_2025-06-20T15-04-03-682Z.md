## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +8 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 units | The extra half-point versus other books offers significant value on a key number in NBA spreads. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 215.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Slightly better odds than competitors (-110 elsewhere) for the same total, creating small but real value. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alternative Spread | Pacers +11.5 | -180 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Adding 4 points to the spread for additional security, creating a strong position if game remains competitive into 4th quarter. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers ML | 245 (FanDuel) | 1 unit | Small stake opportunity on underdog with best available odds; professional underdogs often perform better than expected. |

These recommendations prioritize leveraging the differences between sportsbooks and securing advantageous numbers. Without specific team information, I've kept stakes moderate while still capitalizing on the market inefficiencies that are present.
