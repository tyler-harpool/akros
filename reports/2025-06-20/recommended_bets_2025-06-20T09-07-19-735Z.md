## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +290 | 1 unit | BetMGM offers significantly better value than other books (+260/+265), creating a favorable implied probability edge |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -8.5 | -106 | 2 units | FanDuel's -106 offers superior value compared to -108/-110 elsewhere for the same spread |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 215.5 | -110 | 2 units | BetMGM's extra half-point provides crucial value compared to 215 at other books |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +8.5 | -112 | 1 unit | Best price available for backing underdog to keep it within single digits |

These recommendations focus on maximizing value through line shopping rather than team analysis, given the limited information available. The stakes are intentionally conservative (1-2 units) to reflect the uncertainty without team-specific data.
