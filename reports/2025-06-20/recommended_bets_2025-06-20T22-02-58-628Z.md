## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -290 | 2 | Best available odds for the favorite across books; market implies 75% win probability |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 214.5 | -105 | 3 | Best value in the market at BetMGM compared to other books' pricing |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +7.5 | -110 | 1 | When spread lines are consistent across all books, taking points with the underdog often provides long-term value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +260 | 1 | BetMGM offers the highest potential return for an underdog play, worth a small position if you believe market is overvaluing Thunder |

Note: These recommendations are based on limited information. For more confident betting decisions, additional data on team lineups, recent performance, and injury status would be highly valuable.
