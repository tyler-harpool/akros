## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs OKC Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +160 | 3 | Denver's historical altitude advantage makes them undervalued as home underdogs. The Nuggets' home-court edge typically adds 3-4 points, making this +160 price attractive. |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +11 | -108 | 2 | Double-digit NBA spreads historically favor underdogs covering (approximately 54% of the time). Warriors have enough scoring talent to stay within this margin even in a loss. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Moneyline | Celtics | -180 | 3 | Celtics have demonstrated consistency at home, and this price implies only a 64% win probability, which appears too low for a quality home team in a playoff-type atmosphere. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 219.5 | -115 | 2 | Denver games at altitude typically feature reduced scoring efficiency from visiting teams. Taking BetMGM's line for maximum value compared to FanDuel's 218.5. |

These recommendations aim to capitalize on situational advantages and historical patterns while offering favorable odds relative to the implied probabilities. Always confirm lineups and injury updates before placing these bets, as last-minute changes can significantly impact game dynamics.
