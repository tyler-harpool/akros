## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Total Points | Under 223.5 | -115 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Playoff intensity typically increases as games progress, leading to tighter defense in crucial moments. The total remains high for a playoff contest, offering value on the under with BetMGM. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +10 | -110 | 4 | Denver's championship experience and Jokic's ability to control game tempo should keep this more competitive than the spread suggests. Denver excels at slowing games down and executing in half-court sets. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Total Points | Over 208.5 | -108 | 3 | Both teams have enough offensive weapons to push this over the total. Boston's home court tends to produce higher-scoring games, and the Knicks have been finding more offensive rhythm in recent outings. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Warriors +11.5 | -112 | 4 | This spread is excessive given Golden State's championship DNA and scoring potential. Even in a loss, Warriors' ability to create scoring runs through Curry should keep them within this large margin. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Nuggets | +340 | 1 | High-value longshot play on the defending champions whose experience, coaching, and MVP-led offense gives them upset potential despite being heavy underdogs. |

Remember that for the live bet on the Cavaliers-Pacers game, timing is essential as odds will continue to adjust throughout the remainder of the contest.
