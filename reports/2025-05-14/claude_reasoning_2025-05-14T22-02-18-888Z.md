Let me analyze the three NBA games for betting opportunities. Since we don't have lineup information, injury data, or explicit statistical edges identified, I'll need to work with the odds information provided and apply general NBA betting principles.

First, let's organize what we know about each game:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks (5/14/2025)
- Celtics are home favorites
- Moneyline: Celtics around -198, Knicks around +164
- Spread: Celtics -5 to -5.5
- Total: 207.5-208 points

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors (5/15/2025)
- Timberwolves are heavy home favorites
- Moneyline: Timberwolves around -495, Warriors around +375
- Spread: Timberwolves -10.5
- Total: 202.5-203 points

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/16/2025)
- Thunder are road favorites
- Moneyline: Nuggets around +163, Thunder around -196
- Spread: Thunder -4.5, Nuggets +4.5
- Total: 216.5 points

Now, let's analyze each game for potential betting value:

### Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

The Celtics are 5-5.5 point favorites at home. This suggests a competitive matchup but with Boston having a clear advantage. With no lineup information, I need to consider general team strength and betting value.

The 207.5-208 total suggests an expected moderately-paced game. Both the Celtics and Knicks are traditionally strong defensive teams, so this total makes sense.

Looking at the odds across bookmakers:
- The spread varies from -5 (DraftKings, FanDuel) to -5.5 (BetMGM)
- The total varies from 207.5 (DraftKings, BetMGM) to 208 (FanDuel)

Potential value: There's a half-point edge taking the Knicks +5.5 at BetMGM compared to +5 elsewhere, and potentially taking the Under 208 at FanDuel vs 207.5 elsewhere.

### Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

The Timberwolves are heavily favored at -10.5 points across all bookmakers. This suggests Minnesota is expected to dominate this matchup.

The 202.5-203 total is quite low for an NBA game, suggesting an expected slow-paced or defensive battle.

Looking at the odds across bookmakers:
- The spread is consistent at -10.5 across all bookmakers
- The total varies slightly from 202.5 (DraftKings, BetMGM) to 203 (FanDuel)

Potential value: The odds are quite consistent, with FanDuel offering the best value for an Over bet with a 203 total vs 202.5 elsewhere. However, the heavy spread suggests some caution.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder are 4.5-point road favorites, which is significant. For a road team to be favored by this much suggests OKC is perceived as significantly stronger than Denver.

The 216.5 total is higher than the other games, indicating expectations for a faster-paced, higher-scoring contest.

Looking at the odds across bookmakers:
- The spread is consistent at 4.5 across bookmakers
- FanDuel offers slightly better value on the Nuggets spread at -108 vs -110 elsewhere
- The total is consistent at 216.5 across all bookmakers

Potential value: FanDuel offers slightly better value for a Nuggets +4.5 bet at -108.

Based on this limited information, I'll make recommendations that focus on where there appears to be the best value across bookmakers, while acknowledging the limited information we have about team conditions.

I'll now formulate 3-5 concrete bet recommendations based on this analysis:

1. Knicks +5.5 (-110) at BetMGM - This gives a half-point advantage over other bookmakers
2. Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203 (-114) at FanDuel - This gives a half-point advantage over other bookmakers
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - This offers slightly better odds than other bookmakers
4. Celtics-Knicks Under 208 (-110) at FanDuel - If we believe this will be a defensive battle, taking the highest total gives us the most value
5. Thunder -4.5 (-112) at FanDuel - If we believe OKC is legitimately the better team, this is a reasonable price

However, I need to note that without more information about team dynamics, injuries, and recent performance, these recommendations carry significant uncertainty. In a real-world scenario, I would want much more information before making confident recommendations.

Let me finalize my recommended bets:

1. New York Knicks +5.5 (-110) at BetMGM - 3 units
2. Timberwolves-Warriors Over 203 (-114) at FanDuel - 2 units
3. Nuggets +4.5 (-108) at FanDuel - 3 units
4. Celtics-Knicks Under 208 (-110) at FanDuel - 2 units
5. Thunder-Nuggets Under 216.5 (-110) at DraftKings - 2 units

The reasoning for each:

1. The half-point advantage on the spread gives meaningful value in what could be a close game. The Knicks tend to play competitive games against the Celtics.

2. While the total is low, getting the extra half-point on the over gives us value if the game lands exactly on 203.

3. The Nuggets are typically strong at home, and the slightly better odds at FanDuel provide additional value.

4. Both the Celtics and Knicks have strong defensive identities. Taking the highest available total gives us the best chance for an under.

5. Playoff-style basketball (assuming this is playoff time given the date) often leads to tighter defensive games and lower scoring.

I'm assigning these stakes based on the relative value and confidence level in each bet, with slightly higher confidence in the spread bets where we have clear line-shopping advantages.
