## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total Points | Under 219.5 | -114 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: FanDuel's total is 4 points lower than DraftKings, suggesting value on the under. With both starting lineups in, defensive intensity likely increases in the later stages. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets -7.5 | -110 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Denver appears to have momentum based on odds movements. BetMGM offers a full point better than FanDuel's -8.5 spread, and Jokic tends to help Denver maintain leads late in games. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Celtics -4.5 | -108 | 4 | DraftKings offers the best value on this line. Boston's home court advantage and consistent -4.5 spread across all bookmakers indicates market confidence in this number. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Total | Under 204 | -110 | 3 | Both teams can play strong defense, and Minnesota's significant favoritism suggests they may control pace. Playoff-atmosphere games often trend toward lower scoring. |

Remember that live betting markets move quickly, and the Thunder-Nuggets recommendations are time-sensitive based on the current game state and odds available at the time of analysis.
