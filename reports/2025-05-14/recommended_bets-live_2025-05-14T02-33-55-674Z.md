## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +3.5 | -115 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: The tight spread suggests a competitive game, and OKC's athleticism with SGA typically keeps games close in the 4th quarter. DraftKings offering hook value at +3.5. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 215.5 | -118 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: BetMGM's total is 2 points higher than DraftKings, suggesting line movement hasn't fully settled. Playoff intensity often leads to tighter defense in late-game situations. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Celtics -4.5 | -108 | 3 | Boston's home court advantage and superior depth should allow them to pull away late. DraftKings offers the best price on this spread. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Warriors +11.5 | -112 | 2 | This is an unusually large playoff spread. Golden State's experience and scoring capability make them dangerous even as significant underdogs. |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Total | Over 207.5 | -110 | 2 | Both teams have shown offensive capability in recent games, and Boston's home crowd should energize their scoring output. |

Remember that live betting recommendations require quick action as odds are constantly changing based on game events. Always verify the current lines before placing any bets.
