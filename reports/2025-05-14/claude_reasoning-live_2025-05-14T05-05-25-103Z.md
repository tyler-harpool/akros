Alright, let's analyze the live in-game betting opportunities for these three NBA games. I have limited information about the current state of the games, lineups, and injuries, which makes it challenging to provide precise in-game analysis. However, I'll work with what I have and try to identify potential betting opportunities.

First, let me summarize what I know about each game:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks
- This is likely a playoff matchup given the timing in May
- Boston is favored at home with moneyline odds around -185
- The spread is Boston -4.5
- The total points line is around 207.5-208.5
- No lineup information is available
- No injury information is available
- No current score or game state information is provided

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors
- Minnesota is heavily favored at home with moneyline odds around -600
- The spread is Minnesota -11.5
- The total points line is around 203.5-204

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Oklahoma City is favored on the road with moneyline odds around -185 to -200
- The spread is OKC -4.5 to -5
- The total points line is around 218.5-219.5
- No lineup information is available
- No injury information is available
- No current score or game state information is provided

Since I don't have current game state information, I'll need to focus on analyzing the odds structure across bookmakers, looking for any inefficiencies or arbitrage opportunities, and considering what typical in-game scenarios might present value in these matchups.

Let's start by looking for any discrepancies in the odds across bookmakers:

### Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks
- Moneyline: DraftKings (-185/154), FanDuel (-178/150), BetMGM (-190/155)
  - FanDuel offers slightly better value on the Celtics
  - BetMGM offers slightly better value on the Knicks
- Spread: All bookmakers have Celtics -4.5, but with slight juice differences
  - DraftKings has the best value for Celtics spread (-108)
  - FanDuel has the best value for Knicks spread (-108)
- Totals: 
  - FanDuel has a higher total (208.5) than others (207.5)
  - BetMGM offers the best value on the Under (-105)

### Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors
- Moneyline: DraftKings (-600/440), FanDuel (-620/460), BetMGM (-625/450)
  - DraftKings offers slightly better value on the Timberwolves
  - FanDuel offers slightly better value on the Warriors
- Spread: All bookmakers have Timberwolves -11.5
  - BetMGM has the best value for Timberwolves spread (-105)
  - DraftKings and FanDuel have the same juice for Warriors spread (-112)
- Totals:
  - FanDuel has a higher total (204) than others (203.5)
  - DraftKings offers the best value on the Over (-108)

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Moneyline: DraftKings (154/-185), BetMGM (155/-190), FanDuel (168/-200)
  - FanDuel offers significantly better value on the Nuggets
  - DraftKings offers better value on the Thunder
- Spread: DraftKings and BetMGM have Thunder -4.5, FanDuel has Thunder -5
  - FanDuel's Thunder spread (-5 at -106) offers potentially better value
- Totals:
  - FanDuel has a lower total (218.5) than others (219.5)
  - BetMGM offers the best value on the Over (-105)

Now, let's think about typical live betting scenarios and potential value opportunities for each game:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

This is likely a playoff matchup between two defensive-minded teams. The relatively low total (207.5-208.5) suggests the market expects a slower-paced, half-court oriented game.

Live betting opportunities might include:
1. If the Celtics get off to a slow start, their moneyline odds might offer value as they are generally strong at home.
2. If either team builds a lead that exceeds the pre-game spread, there might be value on the trailing team's spread if the lead isn't sustainable.
3. If the game starts with a lot of scoring, the Under might offer value as both teams could tighten up defensively as the game progresses.
4. Conversely, if scoring is low early, the Over might offer value if shooting percentages are expected to normalize.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

The Timberwolves are heavily favored (-11.5), suggesting this might be a potential mismatch. This could be due to Warriors injuries or rest, or the Timberwolves having a significant home-court advantage.

Live betting opportunities might include:
1. If the Warriors keep it close early, the Timberwolves' spread might decrease, offering better value.
2. The Warriors are known for their third-quarter runs, so if they're trailing at halftime, there might be value on their second-half spread or moneyline.
3. The low total (203.5-204) suggests a defensive game, so if there's unexpectedly high scoring early, the Under might offer value as pace typically slows in the second half.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder being favored on the road against the defending champion Nuggets suggests either significant injuries for Denver or a specific matchup advantage for OKC.

Live betting opportunities might include:
1. If the Nuggets get off to a strong start at home, their moneyline might offer significant value.
2. The relatively high total (218.5-219.5) suggests a faster-paced game, so if scoring is low early, the Over might offer value.
3. If the game remains close into the fourth quarter, Nikola Jokic's clutch performance for Denver could make their moneyline valuable.

Now, let me try to formulate 3-5 specific bet recommendations based on potential live game scenarios and the odds available:

### Potential Recommendation 1: Boston Celtics Moneyline (if they're trailing early)
If the Celtics get off to a slow start and their moneyline odds drift to +120 or better, there could be value in backing them to come back. The Celtics have demonstrated resilience throughout the season and have the offensive firepower to overcome deficits.

### Potential Recommendation 2: Minnesota Timberwolves -6.5 (adjusted in-game spread if Warriors keep it close early)
If the Warriors keep the game competitive in the first quarter but the Timberwolves show signs of pulling away, an adjusted spread of -6.5 or lower would offer value compared to the pre-game line of -11.5.

### Potential Recommendation 3: Denver Nuggets Moneyline (if they're within 5 points in the 4th quarter)
If the Nuggets are within 5 points in the 4th quarter, their home-court advantage and Jokic's clutch performance could make their moneyline valuable, especially if it's in the +150 to +200 range.

### Potential Recommendation 4: Under on Boston/NY Total (if high scoring in first half)
If there's unexpected high scoring in the first half pushing the live total above 215, there might be value on the Under as both defensive teams typically tighten up in the second half of close games.

### Potential Recommendation 5: Golden State Warriors 3rd Quarter Spread (if trailing at halftime)
The Warriors have historically been strong in the third quarter. If they're trailing at halftime, backing them to win the third quarter could offer value.

But I should note that these recommendations are highly speculative without current game state information. In a real live betting situation, I would need to know:
- Current score
- Time remaining
- Current live odds
- Recent momentum/scoring runs
- Foul trouble for key players
- Shooting performance vs. expected norms
- Pace of play compared to season averages

Let me create a finalized table with the recommendations, acknowledging these limitations:
