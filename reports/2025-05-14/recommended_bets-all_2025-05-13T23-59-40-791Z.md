## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +9.5 | -105 (BetMGM) | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books; defending champions with Jokic should keep it competitive even on the road |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Total | Under 208.5 | -112 (FanDuel) | 3 | Full point higher than other books; both teams have elite defensive capabilities and playoff games tend to be lower-scoring |
| Cavaliers vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +14.5 | +100 (FanDuel) | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Rare positive odds on a spread bet; provides cushion against potential garbage time runs |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Total | Under 204 | -110 (FanDuel) | 2 | Timberwolves' elite defense should control Warriors; Minnesota's playoff games have trended under with their defensive focus |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Over 222 | -110 (DraftKings) | 1 | Both teams have elite offensive weapons (SGA, Jokic, Murray); half-point advantage over BetMGM's line |

Remember that the Cavaliers-Pacers recommendation is a live bet and should only be considered if the game situation warrants it. Always practice responsible bankroll management when placing wagers.
