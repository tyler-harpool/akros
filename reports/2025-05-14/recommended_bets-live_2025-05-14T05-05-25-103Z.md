## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Celtics vs Knicks | Live Spread | Celtics -2.5 or better | -110 | 3 | If Boston faces early deficit, look for reduced spread as they typically respond well at home with superior offensive efficiency |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Live Quarter | Warriors Q3 Spread | -110 | 2 | Warriors historically dominate third quarters with adjustments; valuable if trailing at half |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Live Moneyline | Nuggets ML | +168 | 3 | Best pre-game value at FanDuel; Denver's home-court advantage and championship experience creates value if game remains close into 4th quarter |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Live Total | Under if above 212 | -110 | 2 | If early pace is faster than expected, both defensive teams likely to tighten up in second half |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Live Player Prop | Jokić over points | -115 | 2 | If Denver trails, look for increased offensive usage from Jokić who historically elevates in high-leverage situations |

Remember that successful live betting requires quick analysis of current game conditions. Always consider momentum shifts, lineup changes, and foul trouble when making in-game wagers.
