Let me analyze the NBA betting opportunities for the three games scheduled on May 14-16, 2025.

First, I'll organize what information I have for each game:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks (5/14/2025, 11:05:00 PM)

**Moneyline Odds:**
- DraftKings: Celtics -185, Knicks +154
- FanDuel: Celtics -180, Knicks +152
- BetMGM: Celtics -200, Knicks +165

**Spread Odds:**
- Consensus: Celtics -4.5 (around -110), Knicks +4.5 (around -110)

**Total (Over/Under):**
- DraftKings: 207.5 (-110/-110)
- FanDuel: 208 (-110/-110)
- BetMGM: 207.5 (-115/-105)

No lineup information or injury data is provided. The Celtics are clear favorites at home.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors (5/15/2025, 1:35:00 AM)

**Moneyline Odds:**

Minnesota is a heavy favorite at home.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder (5/16/2025, 12:35:00 AM)

**Moneyline Odds:**
- DraftKings: Nuggets +154, Thunder -185
- BetMGM: Nuggets +155, Thunder -190

**Spread Odds:**
- Consensus: Nuggets +4.5 (-110), Thunder -4.5 (-110)

**Total (Over/Under):**
- DraftKings/BetMGM: 219.5
- FanDuel: 218.5

Interestingly, OKC is favored on the road against Denver.

Now let's analyze each game to identify potential betting opportunities:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

Without lineup and injury information, I need to analyze based on the odds. The Celtics are moderate favorites at home with a 4.5-point spread. The total points set around 207.5-208 suggests oddsmakers expect a moderate-scoring game.

Looking at the odds, BetMGM offers the best value on the Knicks at +165, while FanDuel offers the best value on the Celtics at -180. For spread betting, DraftKings offers slightly better value for the Celtics at -4.5 (-108).

These teams are likely playoff caliber given the matchup. The 4.5-point spread suggests a competitive game where the home court advantage is significant.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

Minnesota is a heavy favorite with a spread of 11-11.5 points. This suggests a significant mismatch or potentially key Warriors players being out (though we don't have injury information). 

The over/under of 201.5-202.5 is relatively low for today's NBA, suggesting a slower-paced or defensively-oriented game. 

FanDuel offers the best value on Minnesota (-550) and the lowest spread (-11), while DraftKings offers the best value on Golden State (+440). For the Warriors against the spread, FanDuel offers +11 (-108), which is better than the +11.5 (-112) at DraftKings.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

This is interesting because OKC is favored on the road against Denver, suggesting either Denver has significant injuries or OKC is considered the stronger team. Without lineup information, it's hard to know why.

The over/under of 218.5-219.5 indicates oddsmakers expect a higher-scoring game than the other two matchups.

FanDuel offers the best value on Denver at +160, while DraftKings offers the best value on OKC at -185. The spread is consistent across books at OKC -4.5.

For the total, there's a small difference with FanDuel offering 218.5 while others have 219.5.

Now that I've analyzed the basic odds, let me consider potential value bets:

1. **Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks**:
   - The Celtics being favored by 4.5 points at home seems reasonable. Without additional information, there isn't a clear edge here.
   - The total points line of around 208 doesn't stand out as particularly high or low without context about team scoring trends.

2. **Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors**:
   - The 11-11.5 point spread is significant. Big spreads can sometimes present value on the underdog, especially in professional sports.
   - FanDuel's +11 (-108) for Warriors might be worth considering.
   - The low total (201.5-202.5) might present an opportunity if we knew more about team scoring patterns.

3. **Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder**:
   - OKC being favored on the road by 4.5 points suggests a potential edge for Denver as a home underdog at +160 (FanDuel).
   - Denver typically has a strong home court advantage at altitude, so this line is intriguing.

Based on the limited information available, here are the potential betting opportunities I would recommend:

1. **Denver Nuggets ML (+160)** on FanDuel - The home court advantage at altitude makes this an interesting value bet.
2. **Golden State Warriors +11 (-108)** on FanDuel - Big spreads often favor underdogs covering.
3. **Boston Celtics -4.5 (-108)** on DraftKings - If they're the better team, the home court advantage should help them cover this spread.
4. **Under 219.5 (-115)** on BetMGM for Denver vs OKC - If Denver slows the pace at home to neutralize OKC's advantages, this could go under.
5. **Over 201.5 (-108)** on DraftKings for Minnesota vs Golden State - The Warriors play at a faster pace, which could lead to more points.

I'll now formalize these recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs OKC Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +160 | 3 | Denver has strong home court advantage at altitude, making them valuable as home underdogs |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +11 | -108 | 2 | Large spreads often favor underdogs; Warriors have enough talent to keep it competitive |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Celtics -4.5 | -108 | 2 | Celtics should be able to leverage home court to cover this moderate spread |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 219.5 | -115 | 2 | Denver may slow the pace at home to neutralize OKC's advantages |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Total | Over 201.5 | -108 | 1 | Warriors typically play at a faster pace which could lead to a higher-scoring game |

Let me evaluate each bet's confidence level:

1. **Denver Nuggets ML (+160)** - 3 units: Denver has historically had one of the strongest home-court advantages in the NBA due to the altitude. Being an underdog at home is unusual and potentially valuable.

2. **Golden State Warriors +11 (-108)** - 2 units: Double-digit spreads in the NBA often favor the underdog covering. The Warriors, despite presumably being outmatched, should have enough talent to keep the game within 11 points.

3. **Boston Celtics -4.5 (-108)** - 2 units: A moderate home favorite is often a reasonable bet, though without more context on team form and injuries, I can't be too confident.

4. **Under 219.5 (-115) for Nuggets/Thunder** - 2 units: Denver often plays at a slower pace at home, and if they're underdogs, they may try to control tempo even more.

5. **Over 201.5 (-108) for Timberwolves/Warriors** - 1 unit: This is the least confident recommendation without knowing team scoring trends, but the Warriors typically play uptempo.

But wait - I've noticed a problem. I don't have reliable information about team form, injuries, or playoff context, which are critical for NBA betting. Let me be more conservative and adjust my recommendations:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs OKC Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +160 | 2 | Denver's home court advantage at altitude creates value as underdogs |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +11 | -108 | 2 | Double-digit spreads often favor underdogs covering in professional basketball |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Moneyline | Celtics | -180 | 3 | Home favorites in competitive matchups have historical edge |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 219.5 | -115 | 1 | Denver games at altitude often go under as visiting teams tire |

Actually, let me re-evaluate this further. Without knowing team lineups, injuries, recent form, and playoff context, these recommendations may not be well-founded. Let me adjust my approach to focus only on the clearest value propositions based on odds alone:

1. **Denver as home underdogs** - Denver's home court advantage at altitude is well-established, making them potentially undervalued as home underdogs.

2. **Warriors +11** - Double-digit spreads often present value on the underdog, assuming no catastrophic injury situations.

3. **Comparing odds across books** - BetMGM offers the best value on the Knicks at +165, while FanDuel offers the best on the Celtics at -180.

My final recommendations, focusing on the most evident value opportunities and odds discrepancies:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs OKC Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +160 | 3 | Nuggets' significant home court advantage at altitude makes them valuable as home underdogs |
| Warriors vs Timberwolves | Spread | Warriors +11 | -108 | 2 | Double-digit spreads typically favor underdogs in professional basketball |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Moneyline | Knicks | +165 | 1 | Best odds available on Knicks across all books if looking for underdog value |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 219.5 | -115 | 2 | Denver home games often trend under due to altitude effects on pace and shooting |
