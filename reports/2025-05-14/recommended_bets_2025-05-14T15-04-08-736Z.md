## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Celtics vs Knicks | Moneyline | Knicks | +152 | 2 | FanDuel offers the best underdog value. Playoff matchups between these rivals are often closer than expected, and the Knicks have historically performed well as underdogs in high-pressure situations. |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Spread | Timberwolves -10.5 | -110 | 3 | BetMGM offers a half-point advantage over other bookmakers' -11 spread. Minnesota's home court advantage and the Warriors' road struggles make this spread attainable. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Moneyline | Nuggets | +164 | 2 | Denver offers significant home underdog value with DraftKings providing the best odds. The Nuggets have historically performed well at altitude, especially in playoff scenarios. |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 217.5 | -105 | 3 | BetMGM offers the lowest total with the best odds. Playoff intensity typically leads to tighter defense and lower scoring, particularly in late-game situations. |

These recommendations balance potential return with calculated risk based on the available information. Without specific lineup and injury data, I've focused on finding the best market inefficiencies while maintaining a conservative approach to stake allocation.
