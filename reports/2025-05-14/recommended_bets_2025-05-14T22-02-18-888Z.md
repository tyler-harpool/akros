## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Celtics vs Knicks | Spread | Knicks +5.5 | -110 | 3 units | Half-point advantage at BetMGM compared to other books; playoff games often tighten, making the extra half-point valuable |
| Timberwolves vs Warriors | Total | Over 203 | -114 | 2 units | Half-point advantage at FanDuel vs the 202.5 elsewhere; this could be crucial if the game lands exactly on 203 |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets +4.5 | -108 | 3 units | FanDuel offers better odds than competitors (-108 vs -110); Denver typically performs well at home, making this spread valuable |
| Celtics vs Knicks | Total | Under 208 | -110 | 2 units | Taking the highest available total gives maximum value for the under in what projects as a defensive-oriented playoff matchup |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 216.5 | -110 | 2 units | Playoff basketball often features tighter defense and slower pace; this is the highest total of the three games |

These recommendations prioritize finding the best lines across different sportsbooks while considering the typical dynamics of playoff basketball. Without specific team information, the primary focus is on securing the most advantageous numbers available in the market.
