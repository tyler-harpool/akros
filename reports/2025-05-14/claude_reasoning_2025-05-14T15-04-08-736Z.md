Let me analyze the three NBA games for betting opportunities. I'll consider the provided odds, market inefficiencies, and make recommendations based on the available information.

First, let's organize what we know about each game:

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks
- Game Start: 5/14/2025, 11:05:00 PM
- Moneyline: Boston favored (-175 to -185 range)
- Spread: Boston -4.5 across all bookmakers
- Totals: 207.5-208 points
- No lineup information available
- No injury information provided

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors
- Game Start: 5/15/2025, 1:35:00 AM
- Moneyline: Minnesota heavily favored (-485 to -560 range)
- Spread: Minnesota -10.5 to -11 points
- Totals: 202-202.5 points
- No lineup information available
- No injury information provided

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder
- Game Start: 5/16/2025, 12:40:00 AM
- Moneyline: OKC favored (-190 to -198 range)
- Spread: OKC -4.5 across all bookmakers
- Totals: 217.5-218.5 points
- No lineup information available
- No injury information provided

Without specific lineup, injury information, or statistical edges identified in the analysis, I'll need to evaluate these games based on the odds structures, looking for discrepancies between bookmakers, and using general NBA knowledge to identify potential value.

### Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks Analysis:
- The spread is consistently -4.5 across all bookmakers, suggesting market consensus on the expected margin.
- The totals are very close (207.5-208), again showing consensus.
- Moneyline odds are similar across bookmakers, with Boston favored.
- Without specific player information, it's hard to identify clear edges.

### Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors Analysis:
- Minnesota is heavily favored, with moneyline ranging from -485 to -560.
- There's a small discrepancy in the spread: BetMGM offers -10.5 while others have -11.
- The totals are very tight (202-202.5).
- The large spread suggests a potential blowout, but without lineup information, it's hard to ascertain value.

### Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder Analysis:
- OKC is favored on the road, which is noteworthy.
- The spread is consistently 4.5 points across bookmakers.
- There's a small variance in the totals (217.5-218.5).
- Without knowledge of team dynamics or injuries, it's challenging to identify clear betting edges.

Let me look for the best values and potential inefficiencies across these games:

1. In the Celtics vs Knicks game, FanDuel offers the best value on the underdog moneyline at +152.
2. For the Timberwolves vs Warriors game, BetMGM's -10.5 spread for Minnesota could provide value compared to -11 elsewhere.
3. In the Nuggets vs Thunder game, DraftKings offers slightly better odds on the Nuggets moneyline at +164.
4. For totals, BetMGM offers -105 on the under for multiple games, which is slightly better than other bookmakers.

Since we have limited information about team dynamics, injuries, and no statistical edges have been identified, I'll focus on finding the best odds values and making conservative recommendations.

Now, let me formulate 3-5 recommended bets based on this analysis:

1. **New York Knicks Moneyline (FanDuel, +152)** - This offers the best underdog value, and playoff basketball often sees tighter games where underdogs can surprise.

2. **Minnesota Timberwolves -10.5 (BetMGM, -110)** - This is a half-point better than the -11 offered elsewhere.

3. **Denver Nuggets Moneyline (DraftKings, +164)** - Best value for the home underdog, which is somewhat unusual in playoff basketball.

4. **Under 217.5 (BetMGM, -105)** for the Nuggets-Thunder game - This offers the best odds for the under.

5. **Under 207.5 (BetMGM, -105)** for the Celtics-Knicks game - Again, best odds for the under, and playoff games often feature stronger defensive efforts.

Let me refine these recommendations and add reasoning:
