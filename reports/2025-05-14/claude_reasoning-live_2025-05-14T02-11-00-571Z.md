Let me analyze the available betting opportunities based on the information provided. I'll focus on the live betting situation for the Thunder vs Nuggets game which is in progress, as well as the upcoming games.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (IN PROGRESS)

This game is currently live, and I can see from the odds that Denver appears to be in a favorable position:

### Moneyline:
- Denver (home): -260 to -400 across bookmakers
- OKC (away): +195 to +285

### Spread:
- Denver: -7.5 to -8.5
- OKC: +7.5 to +8.5

### Totals:
- Range from 219.5 to 223.5

This indicates Denver has a significant lead or momentum in the game. The spread of -7.5 to -8.5 suggests Denver is expected to win by around 8 points from this point forward. 

I don't have the current score or game time remaining, which would be crucial for live betting analysis. However, I can make some inferences:

1. Denver seems to have control of the game
2. There's some disagreement between bookmakers about the total (DraftKings at 223.5 vs FanDuel at 219.5), which could indicate uncertainty about the pace for the remainder of the game
3. The confirmed lineups show both teams have their starters in, including Jokic for Denver and SGA for OKC

Since there's a 4-point difference in the totals market between bookmakers (DraftKings at 223.5 vs FanDuel at 219.5), this could present an arbitrage opportunity or at least a value play.

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

This game hasn't started yet. The odds are relatively consistent across bookmakers:

### Moneyline:
- Boston (home): -185 to -190
- New York (away): +154 to +156

### Spread:
- Boston: -4.5 (consistent)
- New York: +4.5 (consistent)

### Totals:
- Range from 207.5 to 208.5

There's consistency in the odds, suggesting the market has stabilized on this game. Boston is favored by 4.5 points at home, which seems reasonable. The total is relatively low for an NBA game, suggesting expectations of a defensive game.

Without lineup information, it's harder to make detailed assessments, but the odds suggest Boston is favored but not overwhelmingly so.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

This game also hasn't started yet. The odds indicate Minnesota is heavily favored:

### Moneyline:
- Minnesota (home): -600 to -670
- Golden State (away): +440 to +490

### Spread:
- Minnesota: -11.5 (consistent)
- Golden State: +11.5 (consistent)

### Totals:
- Range from 203.5 to 204

Minnesota is heavily favored with a double-digit spread, suggesting a significant talent/performance gap. The total is quite low, indicating expectations of a slow-paced or defensive game.

Without lineup information, I can't assess if there are key injuries or rest situations contributing to this large spread.

# Betting Recommendations

Let me now determine 3-5 specific bet recommendations focusing primarily on the live game (OKC vs Denver) since that offers the most immediate opportunity.

1. **Denver vs OKC - Total Points Under (FanDuel 219.5)**
   - With the lowest total among bookmakers at 219.5, FanDuel offers value if the game's pace has slowed or if defense has tightened up. The 4-point difference between FanDuel and DraftKings suggests there might be value here.
   - Without knowing the current score and quarter, this is somewhat speculative, but often live totals reflect recent scoring patterns more than long-term game trends.

2. **Denver vs OKC - Denver -7.5 (DraftKings or BetMGM)**
   - If Denver has established control of the game and has Jokic playing well, they're often able to maintain or extend leads in the second half of games.
   - The point spread difference between FanDuel (-8.5) and the other books (-7.5) suggests potential value at the lower number.

3. **Boston vs NY Knicks - Celtics -4.5 (DraftKings -108)**
   - While not a live bet, this offers slightly better odds than FanDuel for the same spread.
   - Boston has been strong at home and the spread seems reasonable based on the teams' capabilities.

4. **Minnesota vs Golden State - Total Under 204 (FanDuel -110)**
   - This is a low total, but if Minnesota is dominating defensively as the spread suggests, this could hit.
   - Both teams can be inconsistent offensively, and playoff-type basketball often trends under.

Stake recommendations:
- For the live bets (OKC/Denver), I'd recommend smaller stakes (2-3 units) due to the volatility of live betting
- For the upcoming games, 3-4 units on the Celtics spread and 2-3 units on the Minnesota/GSW under

Let me finalize my recommendations in the required table format.
