I need to analyze the current betting opportunities in NBA games, with a focus on live betting for any in-progress games. Let me break down what I know:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets
This game is IN PROGRESS, making it our live betting focus.
- Moneyline: Denver is favored (-154 to -164 across bookmakers)
- Spread: Denver is favored by 2.5-3.5 points
- Totals: Points line ranges from 213.5 to 215.5

Since this game is in progress, I need to consider the current game state, momentum, and any important shifts in the matchup. Without specific information about the current score, time remaining, or recent developments, I'll need to be a bit more general in my analysis but focus on what we know:

1. Denver (the home team) is favored by the bookmakers right now
2. The game seems to be reasonably close given the modest spread (2.5-3.5 points)
3. The totals line around 214 points suggests an average-scoring game for NBA standards

For the Nuggets, they have their core lineup with Jokic, Murray, Porter, Gordon, and Braun. The Thunder have their stars with SGA, Dort, Holmgren, and others.

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks
This game is scheduled for tonight.
- Moneyline: Boston is favored (-184 to -190)
- Spread: Boston -4.5 across all bookmakers
- Totals: Points line is 207.5-208.5

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors
This game is also scheduled for tonight.
- Moneyline: Minnesota is heavily favored (-600 to -670)
- Spread: Minnesota -11.5 across all bookmakers
- Totals: Points line is 203.5-204

For these upcoming games, I don't have lineup information so I'll need to be more cautious in my recommendations.

Let me form some live betting recommendations for the Nuggets-Thunder game and some pre-game recommendations for the other two matchups:

For the live Nuggets-Thunder game:
1. Without knowing the current score and time remaining, I'd generally look for value in the team that might be showing stronger play but perhaps trailing slightly - this often creates good moneyline value.
2. If the game is close, taking the points with either team could be valuable, especially if one team is showing better execution but having unlucky shooting.
3. For totals, I'd want to know the current pace of the game and scoring patterns to determine if the live total seems accurate.

For the upcoming Celtics-Knicks game:
- This spread of -4.5 for Boston seems reasonable given their home court advantage and overall strength.
- The total of around 208 suggests a moderate-scoring playoff-style game.

For the Timberwolves-Warriors game:
- Minnesota is heavily favored with a -11.5 spread, which is quite large for an NBA playoff game.
- The total of around 204 is on the lower side, suggesting expectations of a defensive game.

Without more specific information about the in-progress game, I'll have to make some general recommendations based on the lines presented, with a special focus on finding value in the live Nuggets-Thunder game. I'll need to note that the live betting recommendations would typically be more precise with current game state information.

Now, let me formulate 3-5 specific betting recommendations with stakes:

1. For the live OKC-Denver game: If Denver is trailing slightly but showing better execution, their moneyline at -154 (DraftKings) could be valuable.

2. For the live OKC-Denver game: The total points being set at 213.5-215.5 suggests bookmakers expect more scoring. If the game has been defensive so far, the Under might have value.

3. For Celtics-Knicks: The Celtics spread of -4.5 at -108 (DraftKings) could be valuable if Boston has been playing well at home and the Knicks have shown vulnerability on the road.

4. For Timberwolves-Warriors: The Warriors +11.5 at -112 (DraftKings/FanDuel) looks like it could offer value, as an 11.5 point spread is quite large, especially if Golden State has their key players available.

These are my general recommendations based on the limited information available. I'll present them in the required format.
