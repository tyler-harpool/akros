Let me analyze the betting opportunities presented, focusing on both the current live game and the upcoming games. I'll pay special attention to the game dynamics, player matchups, and potential value in the betting lines.

## Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers (LIVE)

This game is in progress. The odds show:
- Pacers (home) favored at around -175 to -188 on the moneyline
- Spread is Pacers -3.5
- Total is between 222.5 and 223.5

Since this is live, I need to consider the current game state, but I don't have information about the current score, time remaining, or which players are in foul trouble or performing well. The bookmakers are showing the Pacers as the favorites, which suggests they might be leading or have momentum. The relatively tight spread (-3.5) suggests a competitive game.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

OKC is heavily favored at home with moneyline odds around -440 to -450, which implies an 81-82% probability of winning. The spread is -9.5 to -10 points. The total is set at 221.5-222 points.

This seems like a high spread, indicating bookmakers strongly favor OKC. Denver has Jokic, Murray, and a strong core, so this suggests either:
1. OKC has been dominating at home
2. Denver might be dealing with fatigue or other issues
3. Series context I don't have (maybe OKC is up in the series)

## Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks

Celtics are favored at home with moneyline around -184 to -190 (about a 65% implied probability). The spread is -4.5, and the total is relatively low at 207.5-208.5.

The lower total suggests expectations of a defensive battle, which aligns with these teams' defensive capabilities. The spread is moderate, suggesting a competitive game expected.

## Minnesota Timberwolves vs Golden State Warriors

Minnesota is heavily favored at home with moneyline odds around -600 to -670 (about an 86-87% implied probability). The spread is -11.5, and the total is very low at 203.5-204.

This suggests Minnesota is expected to dominate. The low total indicates expectations of a slower-paced, defensive-oriented game.

Now let's look for potential betting value:

1. **Cleveland vs Indiana (LIVE)**: Without knowing the current state of the game, I'm limited in my analysis. The spread of -3.5 suggests a close game, and the over/under line of 222.5-223.5 indicates an expectation of continued scoring.

2. **OKC vs Denver**: The 10-point spread feels high given Denver's championship pedigree and star power with Jokic. While OKC is excellent, Denver has playoff experience that could keep this game closer. The total of 221.5-222 seems reasonable given both teams' offensive capabilities.

3. **Boston vs New York**: The 4.5-point spread favoring Boston seems reasonable. The total of 207.5-208.5 is low, but these teams can be defensive-minded. Without knowing injury information or specific matchup dynamics, it's hard to find clear value.

4. **Minnesota vs Golden State**: The 11.5-point spread is significant, even with Minnesota playing well. Golden State has championship experience and scoring ability that could keep them within that margin. The total of 203.5-204 is very low for NBA standards.

Based on this analysis, here are potential betting recommendations:

1. Denver Nuggets +10 (-110) on DraftKings: Denver has the talent and experience to keep the game closer than 10 points, even on the road.

2. Golden State Warriors +11.5 (-112) on FanDuel: This is a large spread for a team with Golden State's offensive firepower and experience.

3. Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets Under 221.5 (-105) on BetMGM: Playoff games often tighten defensively, especially as the series progresses.

4. Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks Over 208.5 (-108) on FanDuel: Both teams have offensive talent that could push this game over this relatively low total.

5. For the live game, I would need current game state information to make a confident recommendation.

Let me now format these recommendations properly according to the instructions.
