## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +430 | 1 | FanDuel offers superior odds compared to DraftKings (+390), providing approximately 2% better expected value |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -11 | -108 | 3 | FanDuel offers better price than DraftKings on the same spread, suggesting OKC's home court advantage will be significant |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Over 227.5 | -108 | 2 | DraftKings provides better odds than FanDuel (-114) on the same total, value play if teams are shooting well |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 227.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel offers superior odds compared to DraftKings (-112), strategic hedge that provides value if defensive intensity increases |

Note: For more precise live betting recommendations, additional information about the current game state, score, time remaining, and player performance trends would be necessary. The recommendations above are based primarily on cross-book pricing inefficiencies.
