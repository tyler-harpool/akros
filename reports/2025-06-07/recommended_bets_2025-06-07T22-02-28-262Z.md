## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -112 | 3 units | Double-digit NBA spreads historically favor underdogs; even in mismatched games, garbage time often allows underdogs to cover large spreads |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +440 | 1 unit | Small value play with 4.4x return; implied probability (18.5%) may underestimate upset potential in a single-game scenario |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 228.5 | -108 | 2 units | DraftKings offers slightly better odds than FanDuel; high total suggests oddsmakers expect an up-tempo game with limited defensive pressure |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread (Alt) | Thunder -5.5 | +145* | 2 units | Buying down the spread from -11 to -5.5 provides better value if Thunder win comfortably but not by double-digits |

*Projected odds for alternative spread based on standard NBA alt-line pricing

These recommendations balance potential value against the limited information available. The higher stake on Pacers covering the spread reflects this as the most statistically sound play among the available options.
