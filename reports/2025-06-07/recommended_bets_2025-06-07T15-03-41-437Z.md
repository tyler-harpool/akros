## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder (DraftKings) | -520 | 2 | Significantly better value than FanDuel's -590; strong favorites typically win outright despite the juice |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 (DraftKings) | -108 | 3 | Double-digit NBA spreads historically favor underdogs against the spread; represents best statistical value play |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 228.5 (FanDuel) | -108 | 1 | Better odds than DraftKings; high totals slightly favor the under in statistical trends |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Alt Spread | Thunder -6.5 (DraftKings) | -190 | 1 | Buying points down from -11 provides insurance against a closer game while maintaining Thunder advantage |

Without more specific team information, these recommendations focus on historical patterns and optimal line shopping between available sportsbooks. The Pacers +11 represents our strongest play based on longstanding NBA spread statistics.
