## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +440 | 1 | FanDuel offers significantly better value than DraftKings (+390). While Pacers are clear underdogs, the 50-point odds difference represents potential market inefficiency. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +11 | -108 | 3 | Double-digit NBA spreads historically tend to overestimate favorites. DraftKings offers better vig than FanDuel (-112) for this selection. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 227.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel offers better odds than DraftKings (-112). Public betting tendency favors overs, creating slight statistical edge for unders in high-total games. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -11 | -108 | 2 | If betting the favorite, FanDuel offers better value than DraftKings (-112). Home teams laying significant points often perform well in prime-time matchups. |

**Note**: Without lineup information, injury reports, or team form details, these recommendations are based primarily on market analysis and general NBA betting principles. Bettors should verify team information before placing wagers.
