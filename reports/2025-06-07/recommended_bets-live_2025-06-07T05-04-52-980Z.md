| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|

| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 227.5 | -106 (FD) | 3 | Most favorable odds in the totals market; unders tend to have value when favorites are expected to control tempo |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Thunder | -520 (DK) | 2 | If backing favorite, DraftKings offers significantly better odds than FanDuel's -590 |
