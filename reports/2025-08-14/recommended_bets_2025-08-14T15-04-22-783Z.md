## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Spurs vs Warriors (11/15/2025) | Spread | Spurs -1 | -105 | 3 | By late 2025, Wembanyama should be in his prime years while the Warriors will likely be in transition with their aging core. Home court advantage plus projected team trajectories make this spread value. |
| Rockets vs Lakers (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Rockets | -102 | 2 | Rockets' young core should be fully developed by the 2025-26 season, while the Lakers may be dealing with aging stars. The nearly even odds offer value for what should be an improved Houston team. |
| Thunder vs Timberwolves (11/27/2025) | Spread | Wolves +8 | -110 | 4 | While OKC is projected to be excellent, this spread is too wide for what should be a competitive Minnesota team. The Wolves' defensive identity should keep this game closer than 8 points. |
| Cavaliers vs Pistons (10/27/2025) | Spread | Cavaliers -1.5 | -110 | 3 | Cleveland's core should be entering their prime years while Detroit may still be developing. This spread is too small for the projected talent gap between these teams. |
| Nuggets vs Warriors (10/24/2025) | Total | Under 234.5 | -110 | 2 | This total is exceptionally high even for two offensive-minded teams. Early season games often feature tighter defense and less offensive rhythm, making the under appealing. |

These recommendations are based on projected team trajectories, value identification in the betting lines, and strategic assessment of the NBA landscape for the 2025-26 season.
