## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Thunder -4 | -110 | 3 units | OKC started cold (down by 7 at end of 1Q), dropping the spread from -6.5. Their superior offensive efficiency (top-5 in league) should assert as game progresses against Houston's inexperienced defense. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Total | Over 218.5 | -110 | 2 units | Unexpected defensive first quarter has dropped the live total significantly from the opening 225.5. Both teams rank top-8 in pace and have too many offensive weapons for this defensive trend to continue. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Live Moneyline | Spurs | -110 | 2 units | What started as a pick'em has shifted as the Spurs' bench has outscored Dallas 18-7. San Antonio's ball movement (12 assists on 15 made field goals) suggests their offensive rhythm is sustainable. |
| Warriors vs Nuggets | Live Spread | Nuggets -2.5 | -110 | 3 units | Warriors' hot shooting start has kept this game closer than expected, shifting the line from Nuggets -5.5 pregame. Denver's size advantage is beginning to show as they've won the rebounding battle 18-9 through 1.5 quarters. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Player Prop | Mitchell Under 28.5 Points | -110 | 2 units | Mitchell started hot with 12 first quarter points, but Knicks coach has adjusted by assigning their best perimeter defender to him. Mitchell's shooting percentage has historically declined by 8% when facing this defensive matchup. |
