## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant price advantage at FanDuel vs DraftKings (-218); Denver's home court advantage typically commands a premium, making this price attractive |
| Philadelphia 76ers vs Orlando Magic (11/26/2025) | Moneyline | 76ers | -102 | 3 | Home underdogs often provide value, especially with near pick'em pricing; Orlando being road favorites suggests market overvaluation |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Rockets +1 | -108 | 3 | DraftKings offers better value than FanDuel's +1.5 (-112); the half-point edge at this key number provides significant EV |
| Detroit Pistons vs Cleveland Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Spread | Pistons +1.5 | -110 | 2 | Home team getting points in what the moneyline suggests is a competitive matchup (Pistons +105); home court often undervalued in these situations |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors (11/15/2025) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -115 | 2 | Perfect spot to back the road team in a virtual pick'em; Warriors getting a point offers buffer in what should be a closely contested game |

These selections leverage pricing inefficiencies, home/road value spots, and strategic advantages based on the current betting market. Remember to confirm the odds before placing any bets, as lines will shift as game dates approach.
