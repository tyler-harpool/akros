## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 units | Significant 28-point difference compared to DraftKings' -218 line. Strong home favorite getting exceptional value on FanDuel. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs Houston Rockets (10/21/25) | Moneyline | Oklahoma City Thunder | -255 (FanDuel) | 3 units | 15-point better price than DraftKings' -270 for the same bet. Thunder projected as strong home favorites with better value on FanDuel. |
| Houston Rockets @ Golden State Warriors (11/27/25) | Moneyline | Houston Rockets | -115 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Road favorite at reasonable price in what projects as a close game. Line suggests Rockets have slight edge but aren't priced as significant favorites. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Dallas Mavericks | -110 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Even money pricing in what should be a competitive matchup. Spread slightly favoring Mavs (-1) suggests small edge not fully reflected in moneyline. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Moneyline | San Antonio Spurs | +350 (DraftKings) | 1 unit | High underdog value in Christmas Day game. Better price than FanDuel's +320, and holiday games often feature closer contests than expected, making this a valuable flyer. |

I've focused on moneyline bets because they present the clearest value discrepancies in the provided data. The strongest recommendations are the Denver and Oklahoma City plays where significant price differences exist between bookmakers for the same outcome.
