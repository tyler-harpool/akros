## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant value differential compared to DK's -218 line. FanDuel's price implies 65.5% win probability versus DK's 68.6%, representing a 3.1% edge. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 | 3 | FanDuel's -9.5 spread offers better value than DK's -10 for a Thunder team projected to be significantly stronger than the rebuilding Spurs. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Los Angeles Clippers (11/26/25) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -102 | 3 | Getting near even money on essentially a pick'em game offers better value than the -110 moneyline for the Lakers against their arena rivals. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets (11/27/25) | Total | Under 221.5 | -110 | 2 | This total appears slightly inflated given the defensive improvements both teams are expected to make, creating value on the under. |
| Detroit Pistons vs Boston Celtics (11/26/25) | Moneyline | Pistons | -118 | 2 | Detroit as a slight home favorite represents value against a Celtics team likely to rest players during this busy holiday stretch. |

These recommendations leverage the available odds differentials and identify spots where the betting market appears to have mispriced certain outcomes. The stake levels reflect my confidence in each selection based on the perceived edge.
