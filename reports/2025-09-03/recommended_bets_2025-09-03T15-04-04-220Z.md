## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Denver Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant 28-point difference compared to DraftKings' -218 line. Denver's altitude advantage is maximized in post-Christmas home games when visitors face travel fatigue. |
| San Antonio Spurs vs Oklahoma City Thunder (12/25/25) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 3 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' line (+10). Christmas Day underdogs historically perform well ATS, and nationally televised games tend to see more competitive performances from underdogs. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/25) | Moneyline | Boston Celtics | -130 | 3 | Strong value for defending champions at home. Early season games typically favor more stable rosters, and Boston's home court advantage is worth more than the modest -130 price implies. |
| Golden State Warriors vs San Antonio Spurs (11/15/25) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -105 | 2 | Getting a point in what's essentially an even game (both ML at -110) offers clear value. Warriors' experienced roster should perform well in close road environments. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 2 | Better value than FanDuel's -122 line. Post-Christmas home games favor the rested home team, and the modest price suggests value given the Lakers' typical home court advantage. |

These recommendations focus on concrete line advantages between books and historically profitable situational spots, providing a balanced approach to capturing betting value across different game contexts and market types.
