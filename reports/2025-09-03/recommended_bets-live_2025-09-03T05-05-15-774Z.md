## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 3 | FanDuel's -190 offers significantly better value than DraftKings' -218 for the same bet. If Nuggets are maintaining a lead, this 28-point difference in odds creates immediate value. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25) | Spread | Spurs +9.5 | -110 | 2 | FanDuel's +9.5 provides a half-point advantage over DraftKings' +10. In a game with a large spread, this additional half-point protection becomes critical during scoring runs. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26) | Spread | Lakers -1 | -112 | 2 | DraftKings' -1 spread offers better value than FanDuel's -1.5 in what odds suggest will be a tight game. This half-point could be decisive in a close fourth quarter. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets (10/24) | Moneyline | Warriors | -112 | 2 | In this near pick'em game, the slightly favored Warriors at -112 offer value if they're showing better execution and momentum in the current game flow. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23) | Total Points | Over 226.5 | -110 | 1 | With perfectly even moneyline odds (-110/-110), this projected close game could see aggressive offensive execution and pace down the stretch, favoring the over. |
