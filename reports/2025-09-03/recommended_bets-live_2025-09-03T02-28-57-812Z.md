## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Houston keeping game close through first half but line hasn't adjusted sufficiently. Rockets' perimeter shooting is sustainable against OKC's current defensive alignment. |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 4 | Both teams showing stronger defensive intensity than expected. Warriors' transition opportunities limited by Lakers' improved defensive rebounding in second quarter. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Moneyline | Celtics | -130 | 3 | Embiid in early foul trouble (3 fouls), limiting his defensive aggression. Celtics exploiting matchup with small-ball lineup that's creating quality perimeter shots. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Live Quarter Spread | Mavericks -2 (3Q) | -110 | 2 | Doncic finding rhythm after slow start, Spurs' defensive rotations breaking down. Dallas shooting variance likely to positively regress after poor first half. |
| Suns vs Kings | Spread | Suns -1 | -110 | 3 | Suns generating significantly better shot quality (shot locations) despite current score deficit. Kings' early success from three-point range appears unsustainable based on shot contest data. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making as odds shift rapidly. Always confirm current odds and game situations before placing any bets, and be prepared for markets to move quickly after significant in-game events.
