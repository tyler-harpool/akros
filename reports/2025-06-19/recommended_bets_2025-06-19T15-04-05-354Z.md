## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -114 (FanDuel) | 3 | Home court advantage worth ~3 points; Pacers' uptempo style keeps games competitive; half-point hook provides additional cushion |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 221.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 4 | Pacers play at a high pace with Haliburton directing traffic; both teams have efficient offenses; the half-point lower total provides significant value |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +195 (BetMGM) | 1 | Small value play with nearly 2:1 odds; home court and Pacers' balanced offense give reasonable upset potential |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alt Spread | Thunder -6 | -112 (DraftKings) | 2 | If favoring Thunder, the -6 at DraftKings offers better value than -6.5 elsewhere; SGA's scoring ability can help cover this number |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management regardless of these recommendations.
