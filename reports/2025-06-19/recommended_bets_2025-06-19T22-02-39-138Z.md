## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +5.5 | -102 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best spread value with the extra half-point. Pacers should keep it competitive at home with Haliburton orchestrating their offense and Siakam providing playoff experience. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +185 | 1 | While Thunder are rightful favorites, this price implies only a 35% win probability for Indiana at home, which undervalues their home court advantage and offensive firepower. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Over 222.5 | -110 | 2 | The Pacers play at a faster pace at home, and both teams have efficient offenses led by elite guards who can generate high-quality shots throughout the game. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Thunder -5.5 | -118 | 2 | If backing the favorite, BetMGM offers better line value than the -6 elsewhere. OKC's star power with SGA and Holmgren should be enough to secure a comfortable road win. |

This analysis leverages the half-point advantage at BetMGM while hedging slightly with plays on both sides of the spread based on your betting preference. The primary recommendation is the Pacers +5.5, as home underdogs in high-stakes games tend to outperform market expectations.
