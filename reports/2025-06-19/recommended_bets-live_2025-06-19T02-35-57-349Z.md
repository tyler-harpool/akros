## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -105 | 3 | Best value across bookmakers, home teams often perform better than expected in live scenarios as they respond to crowd energy |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 221.5 | -105 | 2 | BetMGM offers the best price, games often tighten defensively as they progress, especially in competitive matchups |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +210 | 1 | Home underdog with potential upset value if they're showing competitiveness in the live game flow |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Alternate Spread | Thunder -3.5 | +140* | 2 | If Thunder are showing control but not dominance, a reduced spread could offer value while maintaining favorite status |

*Note: For the alternate spread, exact odds weren't provided in the data, so this is an estimated value. In live betting, always confirm the exact odds before placing bets as they change rapidly.

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds fluctuate rapidly with game events. Always consider the current game state, momentum, and remaining time before placing any of these recommended bets.
