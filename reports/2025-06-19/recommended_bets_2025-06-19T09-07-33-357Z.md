## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6 | -105 | 3 | DraftKings offers better line than +6.5 elsewhere. Pacers' home-court advantage and up-tempo style should keep this competitive within two possessions. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Total | Under 221.5 | -108 | 2 | OKC's defensive strength (particularly on perimeter with Dort) can slow Pacers' pace. DraftKings offers slightly better value on the under. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Moneyline | Pacers | +205 | 1 | While Thunder deserve to be favored, implied 33% win probability undervalues Pacers at home with no injuries reported. |
| Pacers vs Thunder | Player Prop | SGA Over | N/A | 0 | No player prop odds provided, but would recommend monitoring SGA scoring props as he typically performs well in marquee guard matchups. |

The best overall value appears to be on the Pacers +6 spread, which respects OKC's superiority while acknowledging Indianapolis is a difficult place to win by large margins. No major injuries are reported for either team, suggesting both squads will be at full strength for this intriguing cross-conference matchup.
