## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Moneyline | Thunder | -250 | 3 | BetMGM offers the best value on the favored Thunder. If the game is close or Thunder trailing slightly, this represents good value for the stronger team. |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Spread | Thunder -6.5 | -106 | 2 | FanDuel's -106 provides the best value if you believe OKC can pull away. Worth considering if Thunder showing offensive rhythm or if Pacers defense struggling. |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Spread | Pacers +6.5 | -114 | 2 | FanDuel offers slightly better odds than competitors. If Pacers are keeping it competitive or have key players performing well, this spread provides cushion. |
| Pacers vs. Thunder | Total | Under 221.5 | -110 | 1 | If defensive intensity is high or shooting percentages low, the under becomes attractive. Lower stake due to limited game state information. |

For live betting, I recommend monitoring player performance, foul trouble, and shooting efficiency before confirming these wagers. The stakes are intentionally conservative given the limited information about the current game state.
