## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers (10/22/2025) | Spread | Celtics -2 | -110 | 4 units | Boston at home with just a 2-point spread suggests market undervalues their home court advantage. Elite teams typically command 3-4 points at home, making this a value opportunity in a marquee Eastern Conference matchup. |
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs (10/23/2025) | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -115 | 3 units | This Texas rivalry line is essentially a pick'em, but Dallas should have the talent edge. The minimal spread doesn't properly account for the likely talent disparity, offering value on the favorite at a minimal lay price. |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Houston Rockets (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Lakers | -118 | 3 units | Christmas games historically favor home teams with star power. Lakers at home with nearly even odds represents value, as the spotlight of holiday games typically elevates established franchises. DraftKings' -118 offers better value than FanDuel's -122. |
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Total | Over 229 | -110 | 3 units | Christmas showcase games often feature more offensive firepower and less defensive intensity. These two teams have historically played high-scoring contests, and the holiday atmosphere should contribute to an over-the-total result. |
| Detroit Pistons vs Cleveland Cavaliers (10/27/2025) | Spread | Pistons +1.5 | -110 | 2 units | Home underdogs of less than 2 points historically offer betting value. The small spread indicates a virtual toss-up, giving the home team Pistons a significant edge with the points in what the market views as an evenly-matched contest. |

These selections provide a balanced approach across different bet types and timeframes, focusing on spots where the market appears to have set inefficient lines based on the information available.
