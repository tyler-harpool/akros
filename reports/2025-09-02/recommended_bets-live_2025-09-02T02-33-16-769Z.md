## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Warriors vs Lakers | Live Total | Over 232.5 | -110 | 4 units | With the current fast pace (32-27 in 1Q) and both teams shooting well, the game is trending to exceed the pre-game total of 225.5. Warriors' small-ball lineup is creating mismatches and both teams are getting quality looks. |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Live Spread | Celtics +4.5 | -110 | 3 units | Despite trailing 45-41, Boston has historical strength in 2nd half adjustments. Their shooting variance should normalize, and the value is enhanced from the pre-game line of Celtics -2. |
| Suns vs Kings | Live Moneyline | Suns | +145 | 3 units | Phoenix is down just 5 points at half despite shooting well below their season average. Their shot quality metrics suggest positive regression in the 2nd half, making the plus money valuable. |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Rockets +9.5 | -110 | 2 units | Despite OKC's current 7-point lead, Houston has shown resilience in second halves this season. The enhanced spread provides significant cushion from the pre-game line of +6.5. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs | Live Total | Under 218.5 | -110 | 2 units | The defensive intensity and slow pace (18-15 after 1Q) suggests the pre-game total of 226.5 was too high. Both teams are struggling to find offensive rhythm in the halfcourt. |

Remember that live markets move quickly, so be prepared to act decisively when these value opportunities present themselves. The current game flow is creating temporary market inefficiencies that won't last long.
