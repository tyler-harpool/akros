## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves (12/26/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 | 4 | Significant value compared to DK's -218 line; Nuggets projected to maintain edge over Wolves in Western hierarchy |
| Sacramento Kings vs Phoenix Suns (10/23/25) | Moneyline | Kings | -102 | 3 | Nearly even money for a Kings team that should continue their upward trajectory against a transitioning Suns squad |
| Houston Rockets vs Golden State Warriors (11/27/25) | Spread | Rockets -1 | -110 | 3 | Rockets being road favorites signals major shift in team trajectories; spread offers protection in what should be a competitive game |
| Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (10/22/25) | Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 2 | One-point differential from FanDuel's 224.5 line indicates value; early-season matchups often feature more defensive intensity |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (12/25/25) | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -110 | 3 | FanDuel offers half-point advantage over DK's -10; Thunder's young core should dominate this Christmas showcase against rebuilding Spurs |

These recommendations are based on identifying market inefficiencies between bookmakers and projecting team performance trajectories. As the season approaches, monitoring injury news and lineup changes will be crucial to refining these positions.
