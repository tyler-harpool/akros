## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Lakers vs Warriors (10/22/25) | Moneyline | Warriors | +138 | 3 | Warriors offer excellent underdog value against an aging Lakers team. FanDuel's +138 pricing suggests a 42% win probability, but their projected roster and early-season motivation should give them closer to 48-50% chance to win outright. |
| Nuggets vs Warriors (10/24/25) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -108 | 4 | Denver being priced as virtual co-favorites (-108) against Warriors indicates significant value. Nuggets' core roster continuity and championship experience should make them clear favorites, especially with home court advantage. |
| Celtics vs Pistons (11/26/25) | Moneyline | Celtics | -118 | 4 | This line suggests nearly even teams, but Boston projects to remain an Eastern Conference powerhouse while Detroit continues rebuilding. The -118 price (54% implied probability) severely undervalues Boston's expected superiority. |
| Warriors vs Mavericks (12/25/25) | Spread | Mavericks +4.5 | -108 | 3 | Christmas Day games are typically tightly contested showcase matchups. FanDuel's +4.5 at -108 offers excellent value for a Mavericks team that should remain competitive. The national spotlight tends to produce closer games than regular season averages. |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers (12/25/25) | Totals | Under 229.5 | -108 | 3 | Christmas Day games historically trend under due to increased defensive intensity and the primetime spotlight. The 229.5 total is likely inflated based on regular season scoring projections without accounting for the holiday game dynamic. |

These recommendations balance value opportunities with reasonable confidence levels based on projected team strengths and situational factors. Given the advance timing of these lines, early monitoring of team news and roster developments will be essential as we approach the actual game dates.
