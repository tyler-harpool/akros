## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 units | Large NBA spreads historically favor underdogs, with backdoor covers common. The marketplace has priced this as a blowout, creating potential value on the underdog. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers ML | +330 | 1 unit | While Thunder should win, the +330 payout represents value compared to the implied 23% win probability. Worth a small stake given the potential 3.3x return. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Over 230.5 | -110 | 2 units | With both teams likely playing at pace and the spread suggesting Thunder scoring heavily, the over presents value, especially at the lower number on FanDuel. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Totals | Under 231 | -108 | 1 unit | Small-stake opportunity to "middle" the total if the final score lands at exactly 231 points, leveraging the half-point difference between books. |

This balanced approach targets multiple markets while emphasizing the most valuable opportunity (Pacers spread) with our largest stake. The recommendations include both conservative and opportunistic plays to diversify our betting portfolio.
