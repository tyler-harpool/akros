### Line Shopping Opportunities:

1. **Spread Value:**
   - If betting on Thunder spread: DraftKings offers -9 at -115, which is better than FanDuel's -9.5 at -108 (half point advantage)
   - If betting on Pacers spread: FanDuel offers +9.5 at -112, which is better than DraftKings' +9 at -105 (half point advantage)

2. **Moneyline Value:**
   - If betting on Thunder: DraftKings offers slightly better value at -410 vs. FanDuel's -420
   - If betting on Pacers: FanDuel offers slightly better value at +330 vs. DraftKings' +320

3. **Totals Value:**
   - If betting the Over: FanDuel offers better value at -110 vs. DraftKings' -112
   - If betting the Under: DraftKings offers better value at -108 vs. FanDuel's -110

### Potential Betting Strategies:

Without team-specific information, I'll focus on identifying the best mathematical value from the available betting lines:

1. **Spread Arbitrage/Middle Opportunity:**
   There's a half-point difference between the two sportsbooks (9 vs. 9.5). This creates a potential middle opportunity if you believe the final margin could land exactly at 9 points. By betting Pacers +9.5 (-112) at FanDuel and Thunder -9 (-115) at DraftKings, if the Thunder wins by exactly 9 points, both bets would win. However, this requires risking money on both sides.

2. **Best Line Shopping Values:**
   - Pacers +9.5 (-112) at FanDuel offers the best spread value for the underdog
   - Thunder -9 (-115) at DraftKings offers the best spread value for the favorite
   - Pacers +330 (FanDuel) offers the best moneyline value for the underdog
   - Thunder -410 (DraftKings) offers the best moneyline value for the favorite
   - Over 231 (-110) at FanDuel offers the best over value
   - Under 231 (-108) at DraftKings offers the best under value

3. **Value Based on Typical NBA Spreads:**
   - A 9-9.5 point spread in the NBA typically indicates a clear favorite but not a complete mismatch
   - Historical NBA data suggests that favorites in the 9-10 point range cover approximately 48-50% of the time
   - The total of 231 suggests oddsmakers expect a relatively high-scoring game

### Reasoning for Potential Bets:

1. **Pacers +9.5 (-112) at FanDuel:**
   The half-point advantage compared to DraftKings' line is significant in NBA betting. Betting on the Pacers to cover a 9.5-point spread gives us slightly more cushion, and the -112 juice is reasonable.

2. **Under 231 (-108) at DraftKings:**
   The Under at DraftKings offers slightly better odds than FanDuel. Without knowing team pace and defensive/offensive efficiencies, this is purely a value play based on the available odds.

3. **Pacers +330 Moneyline at FanDuel:**
   If we believed the Pacers had a better than 23.3% chance to win outright, this would represent value. This is a higher-risk play but offers the best underdog value.

4. **Thunder -9 (-115) at DraftKings:**
   If favoring the Thunder, the -9 spread at DraftKings is preferable to the -9.5 at FanDuel, despite the slightly higher juice.

5. **Middle Opportunity:**
   Betting Pacers +9.5 at FanDuel and Thunder -9 at DraftKings creates a middle opportunity where both bets win if the Thunder wins by exactly 9 points.

### Final Bet Recommendations:

Based on the limited information available and focusing on pure mathematical value from the betting lines:

1. **Primary Recommendation: Pacers +9.5 (-112) at FanDuel - 3 units**
   The half-point advantage on the spread is significant in NBA betting, and taking the additional cushion with the underdog seems prudent.

2. **Secondary Recommendation: Under 231 (-108) at DraftKings - 2 units**
   Slightly better odds for the Under at DraftKings compared to FanDuel.

3. **Value Play: Pacers +330 Moneyline at FanDuel - 1 unit**
   This is a higher-risk play but offers significant return if the Pacers can pull off the upset.

4. **Alternative Play: Thunder -9 (-115) at DraftKings - 2 units**
   If favoring the Thunder, the -9 spread offers better value than -9.5.

5. **Middle Opportunity: Pacers +9.5 (-112) at FanDuel AND Thunder -9 (-115) at DraftKings - 2 units each**
   This creates a chance to win both bets if the Thunder wins by exactly 9 points, while limiting losses in other scenarios.

Without more specific team information, these recommendations are based primarily on the mathematical value presented in the betting lines rather than team-specific analysis.

Since we don't have any information about current team form, injuries, matchup history, or recent performance trends, these recommendations should be considered provisional and would normally be refined with additional data.
