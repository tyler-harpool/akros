## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 | Value emerges if Thunder build an early lead but Pacers show offensive efficiency. Indiana's pace creates comeback potential. |
| OKC vs IND | Total | Under 231 | -110 | 2 | Becomes valuable if first quarter is high-scoring due to hot shooting that's likely to regress to mean. |
| OKC vs IND | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 | 2 | If Thunder fall behind early and show defensive adjustments, their talent advantage should prevail despite the heavy price. |
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Thunder -9 | -115 | 3 | Value increases if game remains close into 3rd quarter, as Thunder's superior defensive efficiency typically shows in clutch situations. |

Remember that timing is crucial for live betting. Wait for momentum shifts and line movements that create value before placing these wagers, and always adjust your strategy based on the evolving game dynamics.
