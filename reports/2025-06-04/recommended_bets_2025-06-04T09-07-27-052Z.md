## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9 | -105 (DraftKings) | 2 | Better value than FanDuel's +9.5 (-112); key number protection if game lands on 9 |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 231 | -108 (DraftKings) | 2 | Slightly better price than FanDuel; high totals often face scoring regression |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Thunder -9.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 1 | Good price for backing the home favorite if you expect a double-digit win |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline Alt | Pacers +320 | +320 (FanDuel/DraftKings) | 1 | Long-shot value play; only needs to win 24% of the time for positive expected value |

These recommendations are based on finding optimal price points in the current market rather than team-specific advantages, as detailed lineup and injury information isn't available. When making your bets, consider getting the latest team news before finalizing your selections.
