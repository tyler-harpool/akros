## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 3 | The half-point advantage over DraftKings' line is significant in NBA betting. Historical data shows teams favored by 9-10 points cover only 48-50% of the time. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Total | Under 231 | -108 | 2 | DraftKings offers slightly better odds on the under compared to FanDuel, providing marginally better expected value. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +330 | 1 | While a longshot, this payout implies just a 23.3% win probability for Indiana, which could represent value if the Pacers are even slightly better than expected. |
| Thunder vs Pacers | Middle Opportunity | Thunder -9 / Pacers +9.5 | -115/-112 | 2 | By betting Thunder -9 (DK) and Pacers +9.5 (FD), both bets win if Thunder wins by exactly 9 points, creating a profitable middle opportunity. |

These recommendations leverage the available mathematical edges in the current betting market while acknowledging the limitations of our team-specific information.
