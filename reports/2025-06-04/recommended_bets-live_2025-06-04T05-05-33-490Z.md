## Wednesday, June 4, 2025

## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| OKC vs IND | Spread | Pacers +9.5 | -112 | 2 | Half-point hook provides valuable cushion on a key spread number; shop advantage over DK's +9 |
| OKC vs IND | Total | Under 231 | -108 | 1 | Better odds for under at DraftKings; slight value in the vig differential |
| OKC vs IND | Alt Spread | Thunder -5.5 | +118* | 1 | Hypothetical in-game bet if Thunder start slowly; wait for line movement in first quarter |

*Note: For true live betting analysis, we would need current game state information including score, time remaining, momentum indicators, and in-game player performance metrics. The recommendations above are based on pre-game lines with projected in-game scenarios.

When placing live bets, focus on how the current game flow compares to the pre-game expectations, and look for opportunities where the live lines overreact to short-term game developments.
