Based on the information provided, I need to analyze potential betting opportunities for the NBA games scheduled for Friday, July 4, 2025. However, I notice several limitations in the data provided:

1. There are no actual betting odds provided for any of the games (all the odds tables are empty)
2. No lineup information is available for any of the teams
3. No injury information is provided
4. No statistical edges are identified in the betting markets

This makes it extremely difficult to provide concrete bet recommendations with real odds as requested. The instructions specifically ask me to:
- Provide 3-5 concrete bet recommendations
- Format them in a markdown table with specific columns
- Include REAL ODDS from the data (not placeholders)
- Assign stakes between 1-5 units based on confidence level
- Provide clear reasoning for each recommendation

Since I don't have the actual betting data, I cannot fulfill these requirements properly. I should acknowledge this limitation and explain that without odds data, lineup information, or injury reports, I cannot make specific betting recommendations with confidence levels and real odds.

Given these constraints, my best approach is to:
1. Acknowledge the limitations in the data provided
2. Explain that specific bet recommendations with real odds cannot be made without this information
3. Provide general betting insights about the teams scheduled to play based on my knowledge of NBA teams and potential matchup dynamics
4. Suggest what types of bets might be worth considering once actual odds become available

I need to clearly state that without actual odds data, any specific "recommended bets" would be speculative and not based on the type of rigorous analysis that would normally inform betting decisions.
