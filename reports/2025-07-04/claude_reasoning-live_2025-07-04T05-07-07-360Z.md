Let me analyze the provided information for the NBA betting opportunities. I need to identify if there are any in-game betting opportunities based on the current state of the games, momentum, and recent events.

However, I notice there's a significant lack of data in the information provided:

1. There are no current odds listed for any of the games in the moneyline, spread, or totals sections.
2. No lineup data is available for any team.
3. No injury information is provided.
4. No statistical edges were detected according to the "Betting Edge Analysis" section.
5. There's no information about the current state of the games, such as the score, quarter, or time remaining.

Given these limitations, I cannot provide a detailed analysis of in-game betting opportunities as requested. For live in-game betting analysis, I would need:

1. Current score and game state (quarter, time remaining)
2. Live betting odds
3. Recent momentum shifts or key events in the game
4. Active lineups and notable performances in the current game
5. Any injuries that have occurred during the game

Since this information is missing, I need to acknowledge these limitations in my response. I'll provide general guidance on what would be important for in-game betting and what types of opportunities to look for, but I cannot make specific recommendations without the necessary data.

I'll structure my response to acknowledge the limitations while still providing value to the user. Since I'm required to provide 3-5 bet recommendations in a table format, I'll need to clearly explain that these would be theoretical considerations rather than actual recommendations, as I don't have the data needed to make informed suggestions.

Actually, it seems like the request is for future games (July 5-6, 2025) and the information is incomplete because these games haven't happened yet or the betting markets aren't yet available. In this case, I should point this out and explain that I cannot provide live in-game betting analysis for games that haven't started.

The dates are far in the future (July 2025), so this appears to be a hypothetical scenario. I'll acknowledge this and provide guidance on how to approach in-game betting when the games do occur, while explaining that I can't provide specific recommendations without actual live game data.
