I need to analyze NBA betting opportunities for live in-game betting, but I notice there's a significant issue with the data provided. The betting tables for moneyline odds, spread odds, and totals are all empty. Additionally, there's no lineup data available for any of the teams, and no injury information is provided. The games are all scheduled for the future (July 5-6, 2025), but the request is for LIVE in-game betting analysis.

Without live game data, current scores, or any betting lines, I cannot perform a meaningful live in-game betting analysis. In a real scenario, I would need:

1. Current game scores
2. Time remaining in the game
3. Current live betting lines (which change during the game)
4. Player performance stats in the current game
5. Recent momentum shifts
6. Foul trouble information
7. Lineup changes during the game

Since I don't have any of this information, I'll need to clarify that I cannot provide specific live betting recommendations without the necessary data. I'll explain this limitation and suggest what information would be needed to make proper live betting recommendations.

However, I should note that the date given (July 4, 2025) is in the future, so this appears to be a hypothetical scenario. The NBA season typically runs from October to June, with playoffs ending in June, so games in July would be unusual (possibly Summer League games).

Given these limitations, I'll acknowledge the lack of data and explain what would be needed for a proper live betting analysis.
