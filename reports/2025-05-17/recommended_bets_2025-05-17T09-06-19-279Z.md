## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets +8.5 | -106 (FanDuel) | 3 units | Denver's playoff experience makes this large spread attractive, especially with playoff games typically being more competitive. Best line available. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Playoff basketball typically features stronger defensive intensity and slower pace, making this the highest available total worth targeting. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -3.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Better value than the -4 line elsewhere, giving us the half-point advantage in a game where the Knicks should benefit from home court. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -112 (DraftKings) | 2 units | Playoff games tend to tighten up defensively, making the under attractive at this relatively high total for postseason basketball. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Nuggets | +280 (BetMGM) | 1 unit | Small value play on the highest available odds for a potential upset by the more playoff-experienced Nuggets. |
