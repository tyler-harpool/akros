## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total Points | Over 199.5 | -135 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: This is the lowest available total across books. With bench units likely playing, defensive intensity typically decreases while pace often remains steady, creating value on this lower number. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Spread | Knicks +29.5 | -110 | 3 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: In garbage time, the trailing team often cuts into large leads as starters rest and intensity drops. This spread is historically high for an NBA game, suggesting potential overreaction. |
| Knicks vs Celtics | Total Points | Under 206.5 | -122 | 2 | IN-GAME RECOMMENDATION: Creates a middle opportunity with the Over 199.5 bet, giving a 7-point window where both bets can win. This also hedges against extreme scoring scenarios. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total Points | Under 212.5 | -105 | 2 | Slightly better value than the 213 line at other books. Playoff basketball typically features tighter defense and more half-court sets, especially in close games. |

Note that the live betting recommendations are particularly time-sensitive. As the game progresses, these values may shift quickly based on scoring runs and substitution patterns.
