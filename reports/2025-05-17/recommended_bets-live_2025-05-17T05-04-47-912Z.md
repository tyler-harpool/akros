## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Spread | Nuggets -8 | -110 | 3 units | DraftKings offers a full half-point better than other books (-8 vs -8.5), creating significant value in a tight playoff game |
| Nuggets vs Thunder | Total | Under 212.5 | -105 | 2 units | Best price at BetMGM with the half-point advantage over other books' 213 line; playoff games often tighten defensively as they progress |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -3.5 | -112 | 2 units | DraftKings offers better spread value than FanDuel's -4; half-point critical in close playoff games |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 221.5 | -108 | 3 units | FanDuel offers the lowest total by a full point; significant edge in a potentially high-scoring matchup between these offensive teams |

Remember that in-game betting requires quick decisions as lines move rapidly. These recommendations are based on the current odds snapshot and should be placed only if the current game flow supports the analysis.
