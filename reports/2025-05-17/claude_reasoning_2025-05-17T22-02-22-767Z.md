This makes this analysis challenging without specific team data and with no detected edges. However, I can use my knowledge of NBA teams, their typical playing styles, and market efficiency to identify potential value in the odds.

Let's start by comparing the odds across different bookmakers for potential arbitrage or value opportunities:

Now I'll analyze each game based on team context and betting odds:

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets

This appears to be a game in Denver (since Denver is listed as the heavy favorite and has the negative spread). Denver Nuggets are established as a strong home team, especially in the playoffs, with the altitude at Mile High City giving them a notable home court advantage. 

The total of 213.5 is relatively low by NBA standards, suggesting oddsmakers expect a somewhat defensive or slower-paced game. This makes sense if we consider:
1. Denver tends to play at a controlled pace with Nikola Jokić orchestrating the offense
2. Playoff basketball often features tighter defense and more halfcourt sets
3. Oklahoma City has emerged as a strong defensive team in recent years

The 8-8.5 point spread is significant, indicating oddsmakers see a clear edge for Denver. However, 8 points in a playoff game (assuming this is a playoff matchup given the May timing) is substantial. 

Notable value opportunities:
- The half-point difference in spreads between DraftKings (-8) and other books (-8.5) is significant
- The under at DraftKings (-108) offers slightly better value than other books

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers

The Knicks are favored at home by 4-4.5 points with a much higher total (222.5-223) than the Denver-OKC game. This suggests oddsmakers expect a more up-tempo, higher-scoring affair.

Indiana Pacers in recent years have played at a faster pace, while the Knicks under Tom Thibodeau have typically been a defensive-minded team. The higher total might suggest:
1. The Pacers' up-tempo style is expected to dictate the pace
2. The Knicks might be adopting a more offensive approach
3. Both teams might have offensive strengths that match up well against the other's defensive weaknesses

The 4-4.5 point spread is moderate for a home favorite, suggesting a competitive game but a clear Knicks advantage.

Notable value opportunities:
- DraftKings offers the best moneyline value for both the Knicks (-175) and Pacers (+145) compared to other books
- The half-point difference in the total between BetMGM (222.5) and other books (223) could be significant in a close game
- The half-point difference in spreads between DraftKings (-4) and other books (-4.5) is significant

Now I'll make 3-5 bet recommendations:

1. **Oklahoma City Thunder +8 (-108) at DraftKings**: This is a half-point better than the +8.5 offered elsewhere, which is significant in a likely competitive playoff game. In playoff basketball, 8 points is a substantial cushion, and OKC has shown competitiveness against top teams.

2. **New York Knicks -4 (-110) at DraftKings**: Getting the Knicks at -4 instead of -4.5 at other books provides key value, especially since games often land on key numbers like 4. The Knicks typically play well at Madison Square Garden and should have an advantage if this is a playoff situation.

3. **Under 213.5 (-108) for Thunder-Nuggets at DraftKings**: This is the best odds for the under across all books. Playoff basketball tends to be more defensive and slower, and Denver games often feature deliberate pace orchestrated by Jokić.

4. **Indiana Pacers +160 (Moneyline) at FanDuel**: This represents the best underdog value available, with significantly better odds than DraftKings (+145). While the Knicks are favored, the Pacers have shown they can generate offense against most teams, and the value here is strong for an upset potential.

5. **Under 222.5 (-105) for Knicks-Pacers at BetMGM**: This offers both a half-point advantage over the 223 at other books AND better odds at -105 compared to -110 elsewhere. While the Pacers play fast, playoff basketball tends to tighten up defensively.

Let me format these into the required recommendation table:

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -108 | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books, playoff games tend to be closer, significant spread for competitive teams |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4 | -110 | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books, home court factor, key number value |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 | 3 | Best odds for under, playoff defensive intensity, Denver's controlled pace |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +160 | 2 | Strong underdog value, significant difference in odds between books |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 | 3 | Half-point and odds advantage, playoff defense, key number importance |

I assigned stakes based on relative confidence and betting value, with 3 units for the bets with the strongest overall value propositions (spread advantages and totals with better numbers and odds) and 2 units for the more speculative moneyline underdog.
