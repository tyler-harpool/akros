# NBA Betting Analysis for May 17-22, 2025

After analyzing the upcoming NBA games between the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers, I've identified several betting opportunities worth considering. Despite the limited lineup and injury information, we can still extract value by examining the odds structures across different bookmakers.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets Analysis

The Nuggets are heavily favored with spreads of 8-8.5 points and moneyline odds in the -310 to -325 range. This suggests significant market confidence in Denver, likely due to their playoff experience and potential home-court advantage. The total of 213.5 points is consistent across all bookmakers, indicating a projected defensive battle or controlled pace.

The half-point difference in the spread (DraftKings at -8 vs others at -8.5) creates potential value, as that half-point can be crucial in NBA games that often come down to final possessions.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers Analysis

The Knicks are moderate favorites at home with a 4-4.5 point spread and moneyline odds in the -175 to -185 range. The higher total (222.5-223) suggests expectations for a faster-paced, higher-scoring affair compared to the Nuggets-Thunder matchup.

Again, we see valuable half-point differences in both the spread (BetMGM at -4.5 vs others at -4) and the total (BetMGM at 222.5 vs others at 223).

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets -8 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other bookmakers' -8.5 lines; significant value in playoff scenarios where every point matters |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 3 units | Best available spread for the underdog; playoff games typically tighten, favoring underdogs against the spread |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 222.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Half-point value compared to the 223 line elsewhere; Pacers' up-tempo style should create scoring opportunities |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Thunder | +260 (BetMGM/FanDuel) | 1 unit | Underdog value play; playoff upsets are common and this price offers nearly 3:1 return on a young, talented OKC team |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Playoff games typically feature tighter defense and slower pace; best odds available for this total |

These recommendations prioritize finding the best available number across bookmakers while considering typical playoff basketball dynamics. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection based on the available information.
