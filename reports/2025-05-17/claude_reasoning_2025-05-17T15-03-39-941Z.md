## Betting Value Assessment

Since I don't have lineup information, recent team performance data, or injury updates, I'll need to focus on identifying potential value based on the odds structures and patterns:

1. **Denver-OKC Total (213.5)**: This is a relatively low total for an NBA game, suggesting bookmakers expect a defensive battle or slower pace. The consistency across books indicates confidence in this assessment.

2. **Denver Spread (-8/-8.5)**: There's a slight discrepancy at DraftKings offering -8 while others have -8.5. This half-point difference could be significant in a tight game.

3. **New York Spread (-4/-4.5)**: Similar to Denver, there's a half-point advantage at DraftKings and FanDuel (-4) compared to BetMGM (-4.5).

4. **Pacers-Knicks Total (222.5/223)**: BetMGM offers a slightly lower total (222.5) with favorable odds on the over (-115), while other books have 223.

## Value Bets Identification:

Without detailed team information, I'll look for:
1. Line discrepancies between bookmakers
2. Statistical patterns in similar playoff scenarios
3. Value on plus-money propositions where the odds might not accurately reflect true probabilities

Based on the information provided, here are the potential value bets:

1. **Denver Nuggets -8 (-108) at DraftKings**: Better than the -8.5 available elsewhere.
2. **Indiana Pacers +4.5 (-110) at BetMGM**: Half-point advantage over other books.
3. **Oklahoma City Thunder +8.5 (-105) at BetMGM**: Best combination of spread and odds.
4. **Over 222.5 (-115) for Pacers-Knicks at BetMGM**: Half-point advantage over the 223 elsewhere.
5. **Under 213.5 (-108) for Thunder-Nuggets at FanDuel**: Best odds for this total.

Since I lack detailed information on team form, injuries, or specific matchup dynamics, I need to be cautious with my recommendations. The bets identified offer slight mathematical edges based on the available lines, but without context, the confidence level should be moderate at best.

For my recommendation table, I'll include what appear to be the best values based purely on the odds structure, with stakes reflecting the limited information available.

## Recommended Bets

For my recommended bets, I'll focus on the line discrepancies and look for the best values:

1. Denver Nuggets -8 (-108) at DraftKings
   - 2 units
   - Half-point advantage over other bookmakers' spreads
   
2. Indiana Pacers +4.5 (-110) at BetMGM
   - 2 units
   - The best available spread for the underdog
   
3. Over 222.5 (-115) for Pacers-Knicks at BetMGM
   - 2 units
   - Half-point advantage over other books
   
4. Oklahoma City Thunder +260 (BetMGM/FanDuel)
   - 1 unit
   - Potential value in the underdog at this price point
   
5. Under 213.5 (-108) for Thunder-Nuggets at FanDuel
   - 2 units
   - Best odds for this total
