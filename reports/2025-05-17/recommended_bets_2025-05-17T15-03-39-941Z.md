## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Nuggets -8 | -108 (DraftKings) | 3 units | Half-point advantage over other bookmakers' -8.5 lines; significant value in playoff scenarios where every point matters |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Pacers +4.5 | -110 (BetMGM) | 3 units | Best available spread for the underdog; playoff games typically tighten, favoring underdogs against the spread |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Over 222.5 | -115 (BetMGM) | 2 units | Half-point value compared to the 223 line elsewhere; Pacers' up-tempo style should create scoring opportunities |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Moneyline | Thunder | +260 (BetMGM/FanDuel) | 1 unit | Underdog value play; playoff upsets are common and this price offers nearly 3:1 return on a young, talented OKC team |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 (FanDuel) | 2 units | Playoff games typically feature tighter defense and slower pace; best odds available for this total |

These recommendations prioritize finding the best available number across bookmakers while considering typical playoff basketball dynamics. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection based on the available information.
