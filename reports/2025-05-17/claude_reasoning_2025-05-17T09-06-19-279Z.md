Let me analyze these NBA betting opportunities based on the data provided.

## Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets
Game Start: 5/18/2025, 7:40:00 PM

First, let's look at the odds comparison across bookmakers:

### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team (OKC) | Away Team (DEN) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| FanDuel | -335 | 270 |
| DraftKings | -325 | 260 |
| BetMGM | -350 | 280 |

### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team (OKC) | Away Team (DEN) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| FanDuel | -8.5 (-114) | 8.5 (-106) |
| DraftKings | -8 (-110) | 8 (-110) |
| BetMGM | -8.5 (-110) | 8.5 (-110) |

### Totals (Over/Under)
| Bookmaker | Points | Over | Under |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| FanDuel | 213.5 | -112 | -108 |
| DraftKings | 213 | -110 | -110 |
| BetMGM | 212.5 | -115 | -105 |

From this data, I can observe:
- Oklahoma City is a heavy favorite at home, with moneyline odds between -325 and -350
- The spread is around 8 to 8.5 points in favor of OKC
- The total points line is between 212.5 and 213.5 points

Without lineup information or injury data, I need to rely on the odds comparison and implied probabilities.

Denver as an underdog at +280 on BetMGM has the best value if betting on the Nuggets.
For spread bets, DraftKings offers -8 for OKC at -110, which is better than the -8.5 offered elsewhere.
For totals, BetMGM offers the lowest line at 212.5, with -105 for the under.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers
Game Start: 5/22/2025, 12:05:00 AM

### Moneyline Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team (NYK) | Away Team (IND) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | -180 | 150 |
| FanDuel | -178 | 150 |

### Spread Odds
| Bookmaker | Home Team (NYK) | Away Team (IND) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| DraftKings | -3.5 (-112) | 3.5 (-108) |
| FanDuel | -4 (-112) | 4 (-108) |

### Totals (Over/Under)
| Bookmaker | Points | Over | Under |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| DraftKings | 222.5 | -108 | -112 |
| FanDuel | 222.5 | -108 | -112 |

From this data, I can observe:
- New York is the moderate favorite at home, with moneyline odds around -180
- The spread is between 3.5 and 4 points in favor of the Knicks
- The total points line is consistently at 222.5 points

For this game:
FanDuel has slightly better moneyline odds for NYK at -178
DraftKings offers a better spread for NYK at -3.5 instead of -4
The totals are identical, with both offering 222.5 at the same odds

Without lineup information, injury data, or recent form, I'll need to rely on the odds and some general NBA knowledge to form recommendations.

Let's convert these odds to implied probabilities to better gauge the bookmakers' expectations:

## Oklahoma City vs Denver
Moneyline odds:
- OKC best odds: -325 (DraftKings) = 76.5% implied probability
- Denver best odds: +280 (BetMGM) = 26.3% implied probability

Spread:
- OKC -8 (DraftKings) with -110 = 52.4% probability
- Denver +8.5 (FanDuel) with -106 = 51.5% probability

Totals:
- Over 212.5 (BetMGM) with -115 = 53.5% probability
- Under 213.5 (FanDuel) with -108 = 51.9% probability

## New York vs Indiana
Moneyline odds:
- NYK best odds: -178 (FanDuel) = 64.0% implied probability
- Indiana best odds: +150 (both) = 40.0% implied probability

Spread:
- NYK -3.5 (DraftKings) with -112 = 52.8% probability
- Indiana +4 (FanDuel) with -108 = 51.9% probability

Totals:
- Over 222.5 with -108 = 51.9% probability
- Under 222.5 with -112 = 52.8% probability

Based on this analysis, here are some potential betting opportunities:

1. Denver +8.5 at -106 (FanDuel): Getting 8.5 points for the Nuggets at nearly even money could be valuable, especially in a playoff context where games tend to be more tightly contested.

2. OKC-Denver Under 213.5 at -108 (FanDuel): Playoff games often feature tighter defense and slower pace, making the under potentially valuable, especially at the highest total offered.

3. New York -178 moneyline (FanDuel): The Knicks have a decent home advantage, and the moneyline odds are slightly better than what DraftKings offers.

4. Indiana +4 at -108 (FanDuel): Getting 4 points for the underdog at near even money provides some cushion for a competitive game.

5. NYK-IND Under 222.5 at -112 (either book): Again, playoff basketball tends to be lower scoring, making the under potentially valuable.

Now, I'll formulate my final recommendations based on this analysis, considering the limitations in the available data.

I also need to consider NBA playoff dynamics:
- Home teams typically have a stronger advantage in the playoffs
- Defense usually intensifies in the playoffs, potentially leading to lower-scoring games
- Experienced playoff teams (like Denver, as the defending champions) often perform better than their regular season metrics would suggest
- Star players tend to have a bigger impact in playoff games

Without specific lineup information, I'm making these recommendations based on the odds comparison and general NBA playoff trends:
