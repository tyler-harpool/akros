Let me analyze the available betting opportunities for the two NBA games. I'll need to be careful since these are live in-game betting opportunities, but unfortunately I don't have any information about the current game state, score, or how the games are progressing. This makes it challenging to provide truly informed live betting recommendations. I'll work with what I have, but need to be clear about limitations.

# Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)

## Odds Analysis
Looking at the moneyline, Denver is heavily favored across all sportsbooks:
- FanDuel: Denver -370, OKC +295
- DraftKings: Denver -325, OKC +260
- BetMGM: Denver -350, OKC +280

For spreads:
- FanDuel: Denver -8.5 (-114), OKC +8.5 (-106)
- DraftKings: Denver -8 (-110), OKC +8 (-110)
- BetMGM: Denver -8.5 (-110), OKC +8.5 (-110)

Totals:
- FanDuel: 213 (Over -112, Under -108)
- DraftKings: 213 (Over -110, Under -110)
- BetMGM: 212.5 (Over -115, Under -105)

There's slight variability in the spreads (8 vs 8.5) and totals (212.5 vs 213), which might present some small arbitrage opportunities.

## Game Context
Without information on the current game state, it's difficult to assess momentum or how the game is unfolding. Normally for live betting, I'd want to know:
- Current score
- Quarter and time remaining
- Recent scoring trends
- Foul trouble for key players
- Which lineups are currently on the floor

# New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (5/22/2025)

## Odds Analysis
Moneyline:
- DraftKings: NY -180, Indiana +150
- FanDuel: NY -184, Indiana +154

Spreads:
- DraftKings: NY -3.5 (-112), Indiana +3.5 (-108)
- FanDuel: NY -4 (-112), Indiana +4 (-108)

Totals:
- DraftKings: 222.5 (Over -108, Under -112)
- FanDuel: 221.5 (Over -108, Under -112)

There's a small difference in the point spreads (3.5 vs 4) and totals (221.5 vs 222.5) between sportsbooks.

## Game Context
Again, without current game state information, it's difficult to make informed live betting recommendations.

# Comparing Markets and Finding Value

Since I don't have information on the current game state, I'll need to be cautious with recommendations. However, I can still identify potential value based on the odds discrepancies between sportsbooks:

1. For the OKC vs Denver game:
   - DraftKings offers Denver at -325 on the moneyline, which is better than FanDuel (-370) and BetMGM (-350)
   - DraftKings also offers Denver -8 instead of -8.5 at other books, giving slightly better value
   - BetMGM has the total at 212.5 while others have 213, creating potential opportunities

2. For the NY vs Indiana game:
   - DraftKings offers NY at -180 on the moneyline compared to -184 at FanDuel
   - DraftKings has NY -3.5 vs FanDuel's -4
   - There's a full point difference in the totals (DraftKings 222.5 vs FanDuel 221.5)

Without live game information, I'll focus on identifying the best available odds across books and any potential statistical edges I can infer from the betting lines.

Given these limitations, here are my recommended bets:

1. Denver Nuggets -8 (-110) at DraftKings: This is better than the -8.5 lines at other books.

2. Oklahoma City Thunder +8.5 (-106) at FanDuel: If taking the underdog, this offers the best combination of points and price.

3. NY Knicks -3.5 (-112) at DraftKings: This is better than the -4 line at FanDuel.

4. Indiana Pacers +4 (-108) at FanDuel: Taking the most points available if backing the underdog.

5. Consider the total in the Knicks/Pacers game: The 1-point discrepancy in the totals line (221.5 vs 222.5) suggests potential value on either FanDuel's Over 221.5 or DraftKings' Under 222.5, depending on how the game is trending.

Since I don't have current game state information, I'll assign moderate stake levels (2-3 units) rather than maximum confidence.

I'll now format these into a proper recommendation table.
