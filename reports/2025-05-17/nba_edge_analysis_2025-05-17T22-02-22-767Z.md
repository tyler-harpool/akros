# NBA Betting Analysis for Saturday, May 17, 2025

After analyzing the upcoming NBA games between the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers, I've identified several betting opportunities worth considering.

## Denver Nuggets vs Oklahoma City Thunder Analysis

The Nuggets are heavily favored at home (-325 to -335) with an 8-8.5 point spread. The total sits at 213.5 across all bookmakers, relatively low by NBA standards, suggesting expectations of a defensive battle or controlled pace. Denver traditionally enjoys a strong home court advantage due to the altitude, while Oklahoma City has developed into a defensively sound unit.

The half-point spread difference between bookmakers (DraftKings at -8 vs others at -8.5) presents a key opportunity, as does the slight odds variation in the total markets.

## New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers Analysis

The Knicks are moderate home favorites (-175 to -190) with spreads of 4-4.5 points. The total of 222.5-223 indicates expectations of a much faster-paced game than the Nuggets-Thunder matchup. This aligns with Indiana's typically up-tempo style contrasting with New York's home court advantage at Madison Square Garden.

There are notable discrepancies between bookmakers in both the spread (DraftKings -4 vs others at -4.5) and moneyline markets that create betting value.

## RECOMMENDED BETS

| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -108 | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books (+8.5); playoff-caliber games in May tend to be tighter than regular season contests. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4 | -110 | 4 | Significant half-point value compared to -4.5 elsewhere; games often land exactly on 4 points, making this a key number in basketball spreads. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 | 3 | Best price for the under; Denver typically plays at a controlled pace with JokiÄ‡ orchestrating in the halfcourt, and late-season games often feature stronger defensive intensity. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +160 | 2 | FanDuel offers significantly better odds than competitors; Pacers' up-tempo style could trouble the Knicks, making this underdog price attractive. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 | 3 | Half-point advantage over the 223 at other books plus better odds (-105 vs -110); late-season defensive adjustments often lead to lower scoring than expected. |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management regardless of which bets you choose to place.
