I need to analyze the provided NBA betting opportunities, with a focus on the live game between the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics.

Let's first understand the current situation based on the data:

## Live Game: New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics
- This game is currently in progress 
- The spread is extremely large: Celtics -29.5 points across all bookmakers
- The totals vary significantly across bookmakers:
  * DraftKings: 199.5 (Over -135, Under 105)
  * FanDuel: 206.5 (Over -108, Under -122)
  * BetMGM: 202.5 (Over 105, Under -140)

This massive spread of -29.5 suggests the Celtics are dominating the game by a large margin. This is an unusually large live spread in NBA, suggesting we're deep into the game with Boston having established a commanding lead.

The significant discrepancy in the total points markets (7 points between DraftKings and FanDuel) is noteworthy and potentially exploitable. This suggests different interpretations of how the remainder of the game will play out.

## Upcoming Game: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (5/18/2025)
- OKC is a significant home favorite at -8.5 points
- Moneyline has OKC around -350 to -370 
- Total points around 213 points

## Upcoming Game: New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (5/20/2025)
- Knicks favored by 4.5 points at home
- Moneyline has Knicks at -188
- Total set at 220.5 points

Without specific information about the current game state in the Knicks-Celtics game (score, quarter, time remaining, etc.), I'll need to make some inferences based on the betting lines.

### Analysis of New York Knicks vs Boston Celtics (Live Game)

The -29.5 spread suggests Boston has a huge lead. In live NBA betting, when a team builds a massive lead:
1. Starters often get rested in the 4th quarter
2. The leading team tends to slow the pace
3. The trailing team often plays bench players to rest starters
4. The intensity of defense typically decreases

The total points market shows significant disagreement between bookmakers, which could indicate confusion about how the rest of the game will play out. The under is favored at FanDuel and BetMGM, suggesting the market expects a slower pace with bench players.

Given the large spread, both teams are likely to play their bench extensively if we're in the second half. This typically results in less efficient offense but also less intense defense.

The variance in totals offers potential value:
- DraftKings has 199.5 with Over at -135
- FanDuel has 206.5 with Under at -122
- BetMGM has 202.5 with Under at -140

This creates a potential middle opportunity between the DraftKings Over 199.5 and the FanDuel Under 206.5, giving a 7-point window where both bets could win.

### Analysis of Oklahoma City Thunder vs Denver Nuggets (Upcoming Game)

For this upcoming playoff game, OKC is heavily favored at home. The Thunder are an impressive home team, and the market reflects that. The total of 213 seems in line with both teams' scoring profiles. Since this game hasn't started yet, I'll be less inclined to make strong recommendations without more information about player availability, recent form, etc.

### Analysis of New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers (Upcoming Game)

This is another upcoming playoff game where the Knicks are moderate favorites at home. The line of -4.5 suggests a competitive matchup. The total of 220.5 indicates the market expects a fairly high-scoring game between these teams. Like the OKC-Denver game, without more context, I'll be cautious with strong recommendations.

### Potential Recommendations

For the live game (Knicks vs Celtics), the totals market offers the most interesting opportunity due to the discrepancy between bookmakers. The most appealing play would be trying to middle the total by taking Over 199.5 (DraftKings) and Under 206.5 (FanDuel), though this would require two separate bets.

For single bets, the Over 199.5 at DraftKings (-135) might offer value if we're still in the first half or early third quarter, as bench units often play at a faster pace with less defensive intensity.

Another consideration is the Knicks +29.5 spread, which might offer value if we're into the second half. Even with a large deficit, NBA teams can often reduce the margin in garbage time against bench units.

For the upcoming games, without more information, I would be more cautious. However, based on the provided odds:

For OKC vs Denver:
- The Under 212.5 at BetMGM (-105) might offer slight value compared to the other books at 213.

For Knicks vs Pacers:
- There's only one set of odds provided, so no comparative value is immediately apparent.

Based on this analysis, I'll make my recommendations focused primarily on the live game where we can infer the current state and the discrepancies in the odds across bookmakers.

Let's finalize the recommended bets:

1. Knicks vs Celtics: Over 199.5 points (DraftKings, -135) - 3 units
   Reasoning: With a blowout in progress, both teams likely to play bench units leading to less structured defense. This is the lowest total offered across all books.

2. Knicks vs Celtics: Knicks +29.5 (DraftKings, -110) - 2 units
   Reasoning: In live NBA games with large leads, bench players often enter and scoring margins tend to normalize in "garbage time."

3. Thunder vs Nuggets: Under 212.5 points (BetMGM, -105) - 2 units
   Reasoning: This offers slightly better value than the 213 line at other books, and playoff basketball often trends toward lower-scoring, defensive games.

4. Knicks vs Pacers: Knicks -4.5 (FanDuel, -108) - 1 unit
   Reasoning: Home court advantage in playoffs is significant, though this is a lower confidence play without more context.

Since I'm being asked to provide between 3-5 recommendations, I'll keep all these, but I'll emphasize that the live betting recommendations for the Knicks-Celtics game are based on inferences from the betting lines rather than specific knowledge of the current game state.
