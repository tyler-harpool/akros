## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Spread | Thunder +8 | -108 | 3 | Half-point advantage over other books (+8.5); playoff-caliber games in May tend to be tighter than regular season contests. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Spread | Knicks -4 | -110 | 4 | Significant half-point value compared to -4.5 elsewhere; games often land exactly on 4 points, making this a key number in basketball spreads. |
| Thunder vs Nuggets | Total | Under 213.5 | -108 | 3 | Best price for the under; Denver typically plays at a controlled pace with JokiÄ‡ orchestrating in the halfcourt, and late-season games often feature stronger defensive intensity. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Moneyline | Pacers | +160 | 2 | FanDuel offers significantly better odds than competitors; Pacers' up-tempo style could trouble the Knicks, making this underdog price attractive. |
| Knicks vs Pacers | Total | Under 222.5 | -105 | 3 | Half-point advantage over the 223 at other books plus better odds (-105 vs -110); late-season defensive adjustments often lead to lower scoring than expected. |

Remember to practice responsible bankroll management regardless of which bets you choose to place.
