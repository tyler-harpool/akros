## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Magic vs Heat (10/22/25) | Total | Over 207 | -110 | 4 | This total is abnormally low even for defensive-minded Florida teams. Early season games typically feature higher scoring with defenses still finding their rhythm. Both teams should combine for at least 210-215 points. |
| Warriors vs Rockets (11/27/25) | Spread | Warriors +1 | -110 | 3 | Golden State as a home underdog on Thanksgiving night offers significant value. The Warriors have historically performed well in primetime home games, and getting a point against a Rockets team that would be on the road for a holiday presents a strong opportunity. |
| Mavericks vs Spurs (10/23/25) | Spread | Mavericks -1 | -105 | 3 | This Texas rivalry spread is too small. Dallas with Luka Doncic should be favored by at least 3-4 points against a developing Spurs team. The minimal -1 spread represents strong value on the more established contender. |
| Lakers vs Clippers (11/26/25) | Moneyline | Lakers | -110 | 2 | The Lakers getting even money in what's technically a home game presents value. The Lakers have traditionally drawn more crowd support in shared arena matchups, and this late November game should see them with their rotation established. |
| Cavaliers vs Knicks (12/25/25) | Spread | Cavaliers +2.5 | -110 | 3 | Christmas Day games often see inflated lines for marquee teams like the Knicks. Cleveland getting 2.5 points provides value as they match up well with New York. The holiday spotlight should ensure a competitive effort from the underdog. |

These selections represent the best value based on the projected lines for the 2025-26 NBA season. As we get closer to these games, monitoring injury reports and team trends will be essential to confirm these positions.
