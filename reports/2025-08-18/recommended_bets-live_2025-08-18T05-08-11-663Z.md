## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Rockets +6.5 | -110 | 3 | Value if Thunder are leading but not pulling away decisively in the first half; Houston's youth and pace can keep them within the number |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Moneyline | Warriors | +140 | 2 | If Warriors are within 5 points at halftime, their shooting ability and experience makes this a value play for a second-half comeback |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Total | Under 225.5 | -110 | 3 | If defensive intensity is high early and pace is slower than expected, the under offers value as both teams will likely tighten defense in a competitive game |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Player Prop | SGA Over Points | -110 | 2 | If SGA hasn't scored at his usual rate in the first quarter, look for him to take over as the game progresses, making his live points total valuable |
| Knicks vs Cavaliers | Spread | Cavaliers +4 | -110 | 2 | With the game starting soon, Cleveland has the defensive personnel to keep this competitive against New York's sometimes inconsistent offense |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds change rapidly based on game flow. The most successful live bets often come from identifying momentum shifts before the betting markets fully adjust their prices.
