## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Nuggets vs Timberwolves (12/26/2025) | Moneyline | Nuggets | -190 (FanDuel) | 4 | Significant 28-point difference between bookmakers offers clear value. Denver historically performs well against Minnesota, and FanDuel's price is much better than DraftKings' -218. |
| Thunder vs Spurs (12/25/2025) | Moneyline | Thunder | -405 (FanDuel) | 3 | Better value than DraftKings' -455 for a Christmas Day showcase game. Oklahoma City should dominate the rebuilding Spurs, and the price difference is meaningful for a heavy favorite. |
| Lakers vs Rockets (12/26/2025) | Spread | Rockets | +1.5 (-112) FanDuel | 2 | Half-point advantage over DraftKings' +1 spread could be decisive in what projects as a close game. The Lakers historically underperform against the spread as slight favorites. |
| Warriors vs Rockets (11/27/2025) | Moneyline | Rockets | -115 (DraftKings) | 3 | In this near pick'em game, Houston has a slight edge that's not fully reflected in the moneyline. The spread already favors Houston by 1 point, making the moneyline price attractive. |
| Celtics vs Pistons (11/26/2025) | Moneyline | Celtics | -118 (DraftKings) | 3 | Boston at near even odds against Detroit represents significant value given the talent disparity between these franchises. The Celtics' superior roster isn't adequately reflected in this price. |

These recommendations capitalize on pricing discrepancies between bookmakers and identify situations where the odds appear mispriced based on team matchups and historical performance patterns. The stakes reflect my confidence level in each selection, with higher stakes assigned to bets offering clearer value.
