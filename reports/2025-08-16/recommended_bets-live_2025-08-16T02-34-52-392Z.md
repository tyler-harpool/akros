## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Thunder vs Rockets | Live Spread | Thunder -3.5 | -110 | 3 | Thunder's superior defense typically tightens in second half, making a reduced live spread valuable if game is closer than pre-game spread suggested |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live Total | Under 227.5 | -110 | 2 | If game opened with hot shooting, live total likely inflated beyond sustainable pace for these defenses that typically adjust as game progresses |
| Thunder vs Rockets | Player Prop | Rockets 1H Team Total Over 53.5 | -110 | 2 | Houston's offense typically starts strong before OKC's defensive adjustments take effect, making first half scoring more profitable |
| Lakers vs Warriors | Live ML | Warriors +125 | 125 | 3 | Warriors' ball movement creates consistent quality looks even when trailing, making them valuable live underdogs if they've fallen behind early |
| Celtics vs 76ers | Live Spread | 76ers +4.5 | -110 | 2 | In this historically tight matchup, live spread value emerges when either team builds a seemingly comfortable lead that history suggests won't hold |

Remember that live betting requires quick decisions as odds shift rapidly. Look for discrepancies between the visual flow of the game and the current line adjustments to find maximum value.
