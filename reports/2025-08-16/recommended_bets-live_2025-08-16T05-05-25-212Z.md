## RECOMMENDED BETS
| Game/Series | Bet Type | Selection | Odds | Stake | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Dallas Mavericks vs San Antonio Spurs | Live Spread | Trailing Team +4.5 or more | -110 | 3 | In pick'em games (-1 pre-game spread), the market often overreacts to early runs. When either team trails by 6+ points, their live spread typically offers value. |
| Phoenix Suns vs Sacramento Kings | Live Total | Under if 12+ combined points in first 3 minutes | -110 | 2 | Both teams tend to start games hot, causing live totals to inflate. If early scoring pace exceeds 48 points per quarter, the live under typically offers value. |
| Golden State Warriors vs Denver Nuggets | Live ML | Warriors if trailing by 4-8 points after Q1 | -105 | 3 | Warriors have strong 2nd quarter performance metrics. Pre-game near pick'em (-1) suggests value emerges if they face early deficit. |
| Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers | Live Game Margin | Within 5 points if either team leads by 12+ in 2Q | -110 | 4 | Historical data shows these rivals frequently produce close finishes despite mid-game double-digit leads. |
| Oklahoma City Thunder vs Minnesota Timberwolves | Live Total | Over if fewer than 50 combined points in Q1 | -110 | 2 | Both teams rank top 10 in offensive efficiency but can start games slowly. A low-scoring first quarter typically creates value on the live over. |

Remember that live betting requires quick decision-making. Have these scenarios prepared ahead of time, and be ready to act when the specific conditions materialize during the game. Live odds will vary based on game state, so use these recommendations as a framework rather than exact predictions.
