## Analysis Instructions

Please analyze the provided betting opportunities, focusing on the following:

1. Evaluate the live betting opportunities, considering current game state
2. Look for odds that haven't fully adjusted to game flow and momentum shifts
3. Consider how fatigue and foul trouble may impact the remainder of the game
4. Focus on total points markets that might not account for pace changes
5. Be selective and only recommend high-confidence live opportunities

IMPORTANT: After your analysis, provide exactly 3-5 concrete bet recommendations in a section called "RECOMMENDED BETS". Format these recommendations as a markdown table with these exact columns: Game/Series, Bet Type, Selection, Odds, Stake (1-5 units), and Reasoning. Include REAL ODDS from the data (not placeholders). For each bet, provide a short but clear explanation of why this specific bet has value. For live bets, be sure to note that these are IN-GAME recommendations in the Reasoning column.
